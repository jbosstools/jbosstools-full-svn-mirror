<h2>ModeShape Preferences Page</h2>

<p>The <i>ModeShape Preferences Page</i> provides settings that control what files are included in publishing and unpublishing operations. A publishing operation occurs when the selected files in your local workspace are uploaded to a specific ModeShape repository workspace. While an unpublishing operation occurs when the selected files in your local workspace are removed from a specific ModeShape repository workspace. The <i>Filtered File Extensions</i> preference and the <i>Filtered Folder Names</i> preference each provide a way to filter out certain files from these operations.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>ModeShape Preferences Page</i> looks like:</p>
