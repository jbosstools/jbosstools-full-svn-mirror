<h2>ModeShape Preference Pages</h2>

<p>The <i>ModeShape Preference Pages</i> provide settings that allow you to personalize how ModeShape Tools' publishing operations 
are done. A publishing operation occurs when selected files in your local workspace are either uploaded (published) or deleted 
(unpublished) to/from a specific ModeShape repository workspace. Here's a list of the preference pages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#generalSettingsPrefPage">General Settings</a> - these settings control if published files should be put under 
version control by the ModeShape server.
</li>
<li><a href="#fileFiltersPrefPage">File and Folder Filters</a> - these settings control which files are filtered out of your
publishing operations.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="generalSettingsPrefPage">General Settings Preference Page</a></h3>

<p>The <i>General Settings Preference Page</i> currently only has a setting to control if published resources should be versioned
by the ModeShape server. This versioning preference is used by the <a href="PublishDialog.html">Publishing Operations Dialog</a>.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>ModeShape General Settings Preference Page</i> looks like:</p>

<h3><a name="fileFiltersPrefPage">File and Folder Filters Preference Page</a></h3>

<p>The <i>File and Folder Filters Preference Page</i> is where you identify the file extensions and the folder names you 
<strong>do not</strong> want involved in your publishing operations.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>File and Folder Filters Preference Page</i> looks like:</p>

<p>The <i>Filtered File Extensions</i> preference provides a way to construct a list of file extensions. If a file has an extension 
that matches one of these file extensions it will not be involved in either a publishing or unpublishing operation. To add a file 
extension (ex., txt, jpg, class) simply click on the <code>New...</code> button to display the following dialog:</p>

<p><img src="images/NewFilteredFileExtension.png" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>The <i>Filtered Folder Names</i> preference provides a way to construct a list of folder names. If a file is contained in a 
folder, or has an ancestor folder, with a name that matches one of these folder names it will <strong>not</strong> be involved in 
either a publishing or unpublishing operation. To add a folder name simply click on the <code>New...</code> button to display the 
following dialog:</p>
