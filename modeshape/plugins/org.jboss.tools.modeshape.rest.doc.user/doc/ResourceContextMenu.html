<h2>ModeShape Context Menu</h2>

<p>The <i>ModeShape Context Menu</i> consists of these actions: publish, unpublish, and show published locations. The publish and 
unpublish actions will be enabled when one or more resources (i.e, project, folder, or file) in the workspace are selected. When 
publishing, the selected resources will be uploaded to a ModeShape repository workspace. When unpublishing, the selected resources 
will be removed from a selected ModeShape repository workspace (if they exist there). If a resource has already been published 
using the current Eclipse workspace, the <a href="PublishedLocationsDialog.html">show published locations</a> action will be 
enabled.</p>

<p>Here is what the <i>ModeShape Context Menu</i> looks like:</p>

<p>Files can be filtered out of publishing and unpublishing operations even though they have been selected. Use the 
<a href="ModeShapePreferencesDialog.html#fileFiltersPrefPage">File and Folder Filters Preference Page</a> to filter out files 
contained within the selection based on their file extensions or by the name of the folder, or ancestor folder, they are 
contained within.</p>
