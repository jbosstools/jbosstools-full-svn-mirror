   <title>Publish or unpublish a resource</title>
	 <para>
	    Having registered your ModeShape server instances in <xref linkend="sect-ModeShape_Tools_Reference_Guide-Tasks-Register_a_repository_on_a_new_server"/>, you can now publish files to the repositories on these servers.
	</para>
	<para>
	    Right-clicking on one or more projects, folders, or files in your Eclipse workspace will display the context menu for those files. This menu will now include a ModeShape submenu that allows you to publish or unpublish the resources to your ModeShape repository.
        </para>
	<para>
	   When only one resource is selected you can also view the locations where that resource has been published. The published locations of a resource can be viewed by right-clicking on an individual resource and navigating the ModeShape context submenu to the <guimenuitem>Show Published Locations</guimenuitem> option.

	   The publishing wizard (shown in <xref linkend="ModeShape_publishing_wizard"/>) allows you to choose which ModeShape repository to interact with and displays the selected files the operation will be performed on. When a project or folder is selected all their included files are acted upon. 
        </para>

	    <para>
		  When performing a publish operation, make sure you are aware of the following:
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
	       <listitem>
		     <para>
			   If you publish a file to a ModeShape repository where a version of the same file has previously been published to the repository by you or someone else, the publishing action will overwrite the file currently in the repository.
		     </para>
	       </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <para>
	       When performing an unpublish operation, make sure you are aware of the following:
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>
			<para>
			      If you are interacting with a multi-user repository, the version of the file you are unpublishing may have been updated by someone else after you.
			</para>
		  </listitem>
		  <listitem>
			<para>
			      It is important to be positive a file is no longer necessary when unpublishing as the file in question will be deleted from the repository with this operation.
			</para>
		  </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	 </warning>
	<para>
	   When publishing or unpublishing files, you can see the operation output in the <guilabel>Console</guilabel> view. The type of information that you can view includes the repository where the operation took place, how long the operation took, the outcome for each file included in the operation, a hyperlink that allows you to open the file in an Eclipse editor, and a ModeShape repository workspace URL.
