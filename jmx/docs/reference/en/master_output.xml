    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>Here, we are going to explain how to install the <property moreinfo="none">JMX plugin</property> into
      Eclipse.</para>

    <para><property moreinfo="none">JMX Tools</property> is one module of the <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Tools</property>
      project. <property moreinfo="none">JMX Tools</property> has no dependency on any other part of <property moreinfo="none">JBoss
        Tools</property>, and can be downloaded standalone. Even though the <property moreinfo="none">JMX
        Tools</property> have no dependencies, other plugins, such as <property moreinfo="none">AS Tools</property>,
      do depend on the JMX Tooling and even extend it. </para>

    <para>You can find the <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Tools</property> plugins over at the <ulink url="http://labs.jboss.com/tools/download.html">download pages</ulink>. The only
      package you'll need to get is the JMX Tooling, however the <property moreinfo="none">AS
        Tools</property> would give you a more full experience when using JMX with JBoss Servers.
      You can find further download and installation instructions on the JBoss Wiki in the <ulink url="http://labs.jboss.com/wiki/InstallingJBossTools">InstallingJBossTools</ulink>

        <para>The <property moreinfo="none">MBean Explorer</property><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="changed"> supports several different types of connections. 
            The tooling itself comes only with a default connection type, however other
            adopters can provide additional connection types that may require additional
            or non-spec behavior. Connections can be in either the connected state or
            the disconnected state. Some connection types (such as the default connection type)
            allow you to control the current state. Other connection types may not. </diffmk:wrapper></para>
        
        <para><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="changed">Similarly, some connection types may be able to be created, and others may not. 
            The default connection type, for example, can be created and deleted by you
            at will. The AS Tools connection type, which represents a JBoss server, does not
            allow you this level of control. A JBoss JMX connection is created when a JBoss server is created
            in the server's view, and deleted when said server is deleted. The JMX connection for 
            this server is in the connected state only when the server is started. </diffmk:wrapper></para>
