    <para>Then to follow the simple one you just need to specify host, port (and optionally user
        name &amp; password) and click OK</para>
    <para>The default JMX URL is service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:3000/jmxrmi </para>

        (e.g. Eclipse Equinox), you need chose more advance way, where it's necessary to specify
        explicitly a JMX URL in the Advanced Tab of the JMX Connection window </para>
