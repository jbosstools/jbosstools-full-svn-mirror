    <para>The MBean explorer displays the MBean features (both attributes and operations) in its

    <para>Since It's possible to have many MBean Editors opened at the same time, the MBean Explorer
        has a Link With Editor checkbox to synchronize selections between the active MBean Editor and
        the MBean explorer(and vice versa) </para>

    <para>The MBean Explorer has also a filter text that can be used to filter among all the MBeans
        the few ones, which interest you.</para>
    
    <para>For example, if you are only interested by MBeans related to memory, typing memo will show
        only the MBeans registered under an ObjectName, which contains memo: </para>
    
    <para>A Collapse All button on the MBean Explorer toolbar is used to collapse all the MBeans and
        display only the domains. It is also possible to double click on a node to expand/collapse it. </para>
