    <title>Connections</title>

    <para>The <property>MBean Explorer</property> supports several different types of connections. 
          The tooling itself comes only with a default connection type, however other
          adapters can provide additional connection types that may require additional
          or non-spec behavior. Connections can be in either the connected state or
          the disconnected state. Some connection types (such as the default connection type)
          allow you to control the current state. Other connection types may not. </para>
    
    <para>Similarly, some connection types may be able to be created, and others may not. 
          The default connection type, for example, can be created and deleted by you
          at will. The AS Tools connection type, which represents a JBoss server, does not
          allow you this level of control. A JBoss JMX connection is created when a JBoss server is created
          in the server's view, and deleted when the server is deleted. The JMX connection for 
          this server is in the connected state only when the server is started. </para>

       <para> There are two ways to connect to an application with remote management enabled:</para>

       <para> The first step is the same for both to connect to a MBean Server, click on the

           in the <property>MBean Explorer</property> menu bar.</para>
        
       <para>Then to follow the simple one you just need to specify host, port (and optionally user
           name and password) and click <emphasis>
               <property>OK</property>.</emphasis></para>
        
        <para>The default JMX URL is <emphasis>
            <property>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:3000/jmxrmi</property>.</emphasis></para>
    
       <para>In case you need to connect to an application which has not used the "standard" JMX URL
           (e.g. Eclipse Equinox), you need chose more advance way, where it&apos;s necessary to specify
           explicitly a JMX URL in the Advanced tab of the JMX Connection window.</para>

           <para>Only JMX URL based on RMI are supported.</para>
