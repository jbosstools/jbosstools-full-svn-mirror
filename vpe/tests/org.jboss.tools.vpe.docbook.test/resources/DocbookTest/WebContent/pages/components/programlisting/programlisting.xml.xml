This is a programlisting so white       space and line
breaks are significant.  But it is also a CDATA
section so &lt;emphasis&gt;tags&lt;/emphasis&gt; and &amp;entities;
are not recognized.  The only markup that is recognized
is the end-of-section marker, which is two
"]"'s in a row followed by a &gt;.
