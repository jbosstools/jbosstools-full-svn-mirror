<h3>Log On and Edit Profile Dialogs.</h3>

<p>This package contains two dialogs (as supported by the package
<code>org.apache.shale.dialog</code>):
<ul>
<li><a href="#Log On">Log On</a></li>
<li><a href="#Edit Profile">Edit Profile</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="Log On"></a>
<h4>Log On</h4>

<p>The <em>Log On</em> dialog supports features typically required for
application managed authentication, including the ability to ask for a
"remember me" cookie, and to create a new profile.  Detailed functionality
is configured by setting the following managed bean properties on a bean
named <code>profile$logon</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rememberMe</code> (boolean) - Flag indicating that support for
    "remember me" cookies is enabled.  By default, this feature is
    disabled.</li>
<li><code>userKey</code> (String) - Session scope attribute key under which
    the <a href="../model/User.html">User</a> instance for the currently
    logged on instance is stored [<code>user</code>].</li>
</ul>

<p>The following state diagram documents the flow through this dialog:</p>

<p><img src="LogOn.gif" /></p>

<p>The defined states have the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Check Cookie</code> (action) - If the <code>rememberMe</code> flag
    is set, check for the existence of an appropriate "remember me" cookie
    on the current request.  If such a cookie is found, return logical outcome
    "authenticated"; otherwise, return logical outcome "unauthenticated".</li>
<li><code>Logon Form</code> (view) - Display the logon form and wait for the
    user's subsequent input.  Return the following logical outcomes based on
    what the user actually does:
    <ul>
    <li><code>authenticated</code> - Username and password are successfully
        authenticated.</li>
    <li><code>create</code> - User selected the "Create New Profile" option.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li><code>Create Profile</code> (subdialog) - Use the <a href="#Edit Profile">
    Edit Profile</a> dialog in a special mode to create a new profile (and
    leave the user logged on).</li>
<li><code>Exit</code> (end) - Render the application main menu.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Edit Profile"></a>
<h4>Edit Profile</h4>

<p>The <em>Edit Profile</em> dialog supports the ability to update the current
profile (for a logged on user), or to create a new profile (if no user is
currently logged on).  Detailed functionality is configured by setting the
following managed bean properties on a bean named <code>profile$edit</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>confirmation</code> (boolean) - Flag indicating that a confirmation
    email must be sent, and the acknowledgement received, before the new profile
    is activated.  <em>NOTE - the actual email sending and response receiving
    functionality is not present in this application.</em></li>
<li><code>userKey</code> (String) - Session scope attribute key under which
    the <a href="../model/User.html">User</a> instance for the currently
    logged on instance is stored [<code>user</code>].</li>
</ul>

<p>The following state diagram documents the flow through this dialog:</p>

<p><img src="EditProfile.gif" /></p>

<p>The defined states have the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Setup</code> (action) - Register an instance of our dialog state
    bean with the dialog system, and return logical outcome <code>success</code>.</li>
<li><code>Page 1</code> (view) - Render the first page of the profile,
    and return a logical outcome based on which button the user pressed.</li>
<li><code>Page 2</code> (view) - Render the second page of the profile,
    and return a logical outcome based on which button the user pressed.</li>
<li><code>Page 3</code> (view) - Render the third page of the profile,
    and return a logical outcome based on which button the user pressed.</li>
<li><code>Cancel</code> (action) - Perform any cleanup needed to respond to
    the user cancelling this dialog, then return logical outcome
    <code>success</code>.</li>
<li><code>Finish</code> (action) - Check for a duplicate username, or mismatched
    password entries, and return to the appropriate page on an error.
    Otherwise, create or update the user profile and return logical outcome
    <code>success</code>, leaving a new user logged on.</li>
</ul>

</body>
