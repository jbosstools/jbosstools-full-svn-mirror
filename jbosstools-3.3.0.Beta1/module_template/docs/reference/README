Template for reference guide.

MAVEN:

  How to build everything:
    mvn compile or mvn install

  Just build html-single:
    mvn -Phtml-single compile

  All profiles available: html-single, html, pdf, eclipse

  Look for other <profile>'s in parent pom.

PUBLICAN:

  How to build everything:
    publican build --formats=html-single,eclipse,html,pdf --langs=en-US

  Just build html-single:
    publican build --formats=html-single --langs=en-US

  All profiles available: html-single, html, pdf, eclipse
 

  
Guidelines: 
 use lowercase names for filenames to avoid casing issues
 on various OS's and to make it easier to search for names/content.
 EXCEPTIONS:
	Book_Info.xml
	Name_of_book.xml
	Name_of_book.ent
 The above files must be mixed case for compatability with Publican

 Comment out chapters/sections that are not correct/actively maintained.

 Code in template is there as a guide of which tags are to be used.
 Before committing a revision or new content in a book, ensure it
 is buildable in both Maven and Publican - if you can 
 (Publican currently available for Linux and Windows 
 - talk with irooskov@redhat.com if you can assist with testing on Mac). 

Known issues: 
 Translation depends on ${docname} and other variables
 in artifactid but that is not really supported/recommended by Maven
