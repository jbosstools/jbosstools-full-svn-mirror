<body>

<p>This package contains <code>Command</code> implementations for remoting
support that is implemented using the framework's capbility to map context
relative paths to a particular command in the (by default) "remote" catalog.</p>

<p>Each such command will receive a context instance that can be cast to
<a href="RemoteContext.html">RemoteContext</a>, which conveniently abstracts
the servlet API related issues (and makes the creation of unit tests for these
command instances substantially easier).  In addition, if a remoting command
needs to generate XML output, it may choose to leverage the provided
<a href="ResponseWrapper.html">ResponseWrapper</a> class, whose APIs were
inspired by <code>javax.faces.context.ResponseWriter</code>.  This is not,
of course, the only means by which XML output can be created, but it is
definitely convenient.</p>
