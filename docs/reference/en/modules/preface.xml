                            <para> A set of wizards are provided with the Hibernate Eclipse tools to
                                quickly create common Hibernate files such as configuration
                                (cfg.xml) files, mapping files and revenge.xml as well. Code
                                Generation wizard helps to generate a series of various artifacts,
                                there is even support for completely reverse engineer an existing
                                database schema.</para>
