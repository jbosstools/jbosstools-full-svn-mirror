        <para>To migrate from 2.1 to 3.0 you have to perform a new install of the JBoss Developer Studio 3.0 and undertake all the steps of the
            installation process that is fully described in

        <para>Since JBoss Developer Studio 3.0 uses a new version of Eclipse, an update from within Eclipse cannot be performed as it was when upgrading from JBoss Developer Studio 2.0 to 2.1.</para>
        <para>When the installation process is complete you can point to your old workspace directory and continue working with your projects created using previous JBoss Developer Studio versions, or create a new one and import old projects into the new workspace.

            <title>Note:</title>
            <para>In JBDS 3.0, Linux users no longer need to install the library <filename>libstdc+.so.5</filename>. This library is no longer required and can be removed from the system.
