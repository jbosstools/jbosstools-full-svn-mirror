  <para>
    The sections in this chapter provide a single point of navigation to related concepts, tasks and reference material categorised according to the relevant concept.

    <para>
      The "Document navigation chapter" lists the concepts, tasks and reference material related to a particular "feature" (implemented concept). Splitting the concepts and tasks according to an underlying feature, as is the fundamental design of this template, allows the related concepts and tasks be easily identified. The exception is the reference section as it is categorized according to the wizards, views, editors and perspectives.

    <para>
      The links to the tasks link to the proc-procedure_name id rather than the "task" section id. This way, the links and the procedures can be moved to a new document and still function (the "task" section id might change but the procedure id will remain constant as this is largely based on the dialog title).
