  <title>Link Sets</title>
 <note><title>***Design Note***</title>
    <para>
      The link sets are designed to minimise maintenance. Instead of duplicating links (alternate paths) in each procedure, list a link set (paths to tasks) for the wizard ,view or dialog etc. Include a screenshot. 
    </para>
    <para>
      A concepts heading and links to concepts can also be included.
    </para>
  </note>
  
  <para>
    The following sections list the links relating to a particular topic or the paths accessible from a single dialog or view.  
  </para>
  <note><title>***Design Note***</title>
      <para>
         Note that "links" is included in the title of the destination section (and section id). This is to distinguish the links in the doc from the actual Reference material.  
      </para>
      <para>
         Where links are provided to "Tasks" they will either be: 
      </para>
      <para>
        1. Links to the individual tasks from an interface which includes many different options or many paths.
      </para>
      <para>
        2. Links to further tasks that would naturally follow the resolution of a particular task.
      </para>
      <para>
        A continuation of a task forming a single linear path would be designated as a single link at the end of the relevant procedure and not contained within a linkset.
      </para>
