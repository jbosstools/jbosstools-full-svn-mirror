				<b>Handling timeouts gracefully</b>

				Previously a user ran into an error dialog when the application wizard had timed out. 
				He then could only cancel the creation wizard and use the import wizard to add the application to his workspace. 
				<br />A new dialog box has since been added that asks a user if he'd wish to continue waiting for the remote 
				application to become reachable or to close the wizard. This ensures that the user doesn't get stuck while creating and importing his OpenShift application.

				OpenShift gears constrain the resources an application may consume. A small (standard) gear offers 512MB of RAM and 1GB of disk storage.
				You may leverage more RAM and disk space by choosing a large gear. Standard user may currently only choose small gears though.
				<br />OpenShift may now also scale applications. It will then bundle several gears and offer even more resources to your application. <br />JBoss Tools 
				now offers you both options at creation time. You may choose among available gears and enable scaling when you create your application.

				<b>Defaulting to id_rsa</b>

			<td>
				The former incarnation of the rhc command line tools used a fixed key name for SSH connections. 
				The SSH configuration contained &quot;libra_id_rsa&quot; hard coded into the file /user/.ssh/config for SSH connections to OpenShift. 
				This caused issues for users who already used a different SSH configuration. The rhc command line tools no longer include hard code keys, 
				and instead uses the existing &quot;libra_id_rsa&quot; key or suggests using rsa_id if a key does not exist. 
				This behaviour has been replicated in the tooling.

				JBoss Tools allows you look at the log and the environment variables of a given OpenShift application.

				to the OpenShift Explorer to find these actions. Since CR1 you'll now also find them in the server adapter.
