<h1>Teiid Designer 7.1.0 M2 What's New</h1>
<p>Last revised August 26, 2010</p>
<p><b>Teiid Designer</b>, which is new to JBoss Tools, 
is a visual tool that enables rapid, model-driven definition, integration, management and testing of data services without programming using the <b>Teiid</b> runtime framework.</p>
<p>Below is simple introduction to the tool and a summary of a few basic concepts.</p>
<p>For more details on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/teiid.html">Teiid</a> and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/teiiddesigner.html">Teiid Designer</a> visit: <a href="http://www.teiid.org">http://www.teiid.org</a></p>

      <p><b>Designer "modeling" Perspective</b></p></td>
      <td valign="top">
		  <p>The Teiid Designer perspective provides a modeling-centric
		      explorer designed to aid in creating/editing and managing models (XMI/EMF-based) and
		      Virtual Databases (VDBs). When deployed to Teiid server, these VDB's are treated like
		      any other JDBC data source and queried.</p>
		      <p><img src="images/designer-perspective.png" alt="Teiid Designer Perspective"/></p>
		      <p>If you've been following Teiid Designer since 7.0 development you'll know that the 7.1 version
		      reflects major changes to both Preview Data functionality and VDB editing and VDB execution. These features
		      are now tied to standard application deployment technology through the Teiid Admin API.
		      In Designer, the Teiid view is a window to view the contents of deployed Teiid artifacts, namely Data Sources and
		      Virtual Databases (VDB's).</p>
		  <p>A <strong>model</strong> is a   representation of a set of information constructs. 
		   A familiar <strong>model</strong> is the <strong>relational</strong> <strong>model</strong>, which 
		   defines tables composed of columns and containing records of data. Another 
		   familiar model is the <strong>XML</strong> <strong>model</strong>, which defines hierarchical data sets. </p>
		  <p>In <strong>Teiid Designer</strong>, models are used to define the entities, and relationships between those 
		  entities, required to fully define the integration of information sets so that they may be accessed in a uniform manner, 
		  using a single API and   access protocol. The file extension used for these models is '<strong>.xmi</strong>' 
		  ( Example: NorthwindOracle.xmi ). </p>
		  <p>Below is an example of the partial contents of a model file.</p>
		  <p><img src="images/sample-model-file.png" alt="Sample Model File" border="1"/></p>
		  <p>The fundamental models in <strong>Teiid Designer</strong> define the structural and data 
		  characteristics of the information contained in data sources. These are referred to 
		  as <strong><EM>source</EM></strong> models<span class="medium"></span>. 
		  Teiid uses the information in <strong>source</strong> models to federate the information 
		  in multiple sources, so that from a user's viewpoint these all appear to be in a single source.</p>
		  <p>In addition to <strong>source</strong> models, Teiid Designer provides the ability to 
		  define a variety of <em><strong>view</strong></em> models<span class="medium"></span>. These can be used to define 
		  a layer of abstraction above the physical (or <strong>source</strong>) layer, so that information can 
		  be presented to end users and consuming applications in business terms rather than as it is physically stored. 
		  Views are mapped to sources using transformations between models. These <EM>business views</EM> can be in a 
		  variety of forms: </p>
		  <ul>
		    <li><strong>Relational</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>XML</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>XML Service</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Web services</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Relationship </strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Extension</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Function </strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Uml 2.0 </strong></li>

    <p><b>The Virtual Database (VDB)</b></p></td>
    <td valign="top">
	    <p>A <strong>VDB</strong>, or <strong>Virtual Database</strong> is a container for your models and pertinent source connection data used by 
        Teiid query engine to access your federated data.</p>
        <p>Teiid Designer allows you to create and edit VDBs. The VDB is a zip-like file that contains sources 
        and view models, source connection  information and index files used at runtime for data identification 
        and a manifest to pull it all together. </p>
        <p>VDBs contain two primary varieties of model types - source and view. Source models represent the structure 
        and characteristics of physical data sources, whereas view models represent the structure and characteristics 
        of abstract structures you want to expose to your applications.</p>
        <p>Each source model must contain connectivity information in order for the <strong>Teiid</strong> engine understand which 
        connection factory/data source instance to connect with. In particular, a "<strong>Translator</strong>" name and an existing 
        "<strong>JNDI</strong>" name must be defined.</p>
        <p>After a VDB is defined, it must be deployed to the <strong>Teiid</strong> query engine to be accessed. You can select a 
        VDB in your Model Explorer and right-click select "<strong>Modeling > Deploy VDB</strong>" action or drag the VDB onto an 
        existing server connected in your <strong>Teiid</strong> view. </p>

      <p><b>Teiid as JDBC Data Source</b></p></td>
      <td valign="top">
          <p><strong>Teiid Designer 7.1</strong> offers a JDBC Connection Profile contribution through the DTP extension point. The properties for 
          this connection include standard JDBC inputs including URL, host, port, user-name and password.</p>
          <p>Through this connection, you can perform standard SQL queries. The nature of Teiid VDB's allows complex, multi-source
          modeling and data transformation, so you can design views targeted for your front-end applications and simplify or reduce
          the work necessary to pull all that data together.</p>

      <td valign="top">
          <p><strong>Teiid Designer 7.1</strong> supports generation of deployable web service War Files. 
          For VDB's that contain web service models, there is a contextual menu 
option to generate a JBossWS-CXF war. This generated war can be deployed to 
a JBossAS server with CXF enabled. The wizard will ask for a war context name, 
target namespace, JNDI name for the deployed Teiid VDB, and location to generate 
the war file. Once deployed, the wsdl can be obtained via <b><i>http://host:port/warContextName?wsdl</i></b></p>
