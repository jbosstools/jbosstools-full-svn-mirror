<h1>Teiid Designer 7.1.0 M2 What's New</h1>
<p align="right"><a href="../index.html">&lt; Main Index</a> <a href="../modeshape/modeshape-news-7.1.0.M2.html">Modeshape &gt;</a></p>
<p>Last revised August 26, 2010</p>
<p><b>Teiid Designer</b>, which is new to JBoss Tools, 
is a graphical data modeling tool that enables rapid definition, integration, management and testing of data services without 
programming using the <b>Teiid</b> runtime engine.</p>
<p>Below is simple introduction to the tool and a summary of a few basic concepts.</p>
<p>For more details on <a href="http://www.jboss.org/teiid.html">Teiid</a> and <a href="http://www.jboss.org/teiiddesigner.html">Teiid Designer</a> visit: <a href="http://www.teiid.org">http://www.teiid.org</a></p>

      <p><b>Designer "modeling" Perspective</b></p></td>
      <td valign="top">
		  <p>The Teiid Designer perspective provides a model
		      explorer for creating, editing and managing models (XMI/EMF-based) and
		      Virtual Databases (VDBs). When deployed to Teiid server, these VDBs can be accessed like
		      any other JDBC data source and queried.</p>
		      <p><img src="images/designer-perspective.png" alt="Teiid Designer Perspective"/></p>
		  <p>A <strong>model</strong> is a   representation of a set of information constructs. 
		   A familiar model type is the <strong>relational</strong> <strong>model</strong>, which 
		   defines tables composed of columns and containing records of data. Another 
		   familiar model type is the <strong>XML</strong> <strong>model</strong>, which defines hierarchical data sets. </p>
		  <p>In <strong>Teiid Designer</strong>, models are used to define the entities, and relationships between those 
		  entities, required to fully define the integration of information sets so that they may be accessed in a uniform manner, 
		  using a single API and   access protocol. The file extension used for these models is '<strong>.xmi</strong>' 
		  ( Example: NorthwindOracle.xmi ). </p>
		  <p>Below is an example of the partial contents of a model file.</p>
		  <p><img src="images/sample-model-file.png" alt="Sample Model File" border="1"/></p>
		  <p>The fundamental models in <strong>Teiid Designer</strong> define the structural and data 
		  characteristics of the information contained in data sources. These are referred to 
		  as <strong><EM>source</EM></strong> models<span class="medium"></span>. 
		  Teiid uses the information in <strong>source</strong> models to federate the information 
		  from multiple sources, so that from a user's viewpoint these all appear to be in a single source.</p>
		  <p>In addition to <strong>source</strong> models, Teiid Designer provides the ability to 
		  define a variety of <em><strong>view</strong></em> models<span class="medium"></span>. These can be used to define 
		  a layer of abstraction above the physical (or <strong>source</strong>) layer, so that information can 
		  be presented to end users and consuming applications in business terms rather than as it is physically stored. 
		  Views are mapped to sources using transformations between models. These <EM>business views</EM> can be in a 
		  variety of forms: </p>
		  <ul>
		    <li><strong>Relational</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>XML</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Web services</strong></li>
		    <li><strong>Uml 2.0 </strong></li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>In Teiid Designer 7.1 you can Preview Data through the models you've created and execute queries against VDBs created
		  in your workspace. These features are enabled by deployment of VDB artifacts to an instance of Teiid running in an 
		  application server. In Designer, the Teiid view is a window which displays the contents of your deployed Teiid artifacts, 
		  namely Data Sources and Virtual Databases (VDBs).</p>

    <p><b>The Virtual Database (VDB)</b></p></td>
    <td valign="top">
	    <p>A <strong>VDB</strong>, or <strong>Virtual Database</strong> is a container for your models and pertinent source connection data used by 
        Teiid query engine to access your federated data.</p>
        <p>Teiid Designer allows you to create and edit VDBs. The VDB is a zip archive file that contains sources 
        and view models, source connection properties, index files used at runtime for data identification,  
        and a manifest to pull it all together. </p>
        <p>Each source model must contain connectivity information in order for the <strong>Teiid</strong> engine understand which 
        connection factory/data source instance to connect with. In particular, a "<strong>Translator</strong>" name and an existing 
        "<strong>JNDI</strong>" name must be defined.</p>
        <p>After a VDB is defined, it must be deployed to the <strong>Teiid</strong> instance to be accessed. You can select a 
        VDB in your Model Explorer and right-click select "<strong>Modeling > Deploy VDB</strong>" action or drag the VDB onto an 
        existing server connected in your <strong>Teiid</strong> view. </p>

      <p><b>Teiid as JDBC Data Source</b></p></td>
      <td valign="top">
          <p><strong>Teiid Designer 7.1</strong> provides access to the VDBs deployed to Teiid via a JDBC Connection Profile in the 
          Eclipse Database Development perspective. The properties for 
          this connection include standard JDBC inputs including URL, host, port, user-name and password.</p>
          <p>Through this connection, you can perform standard SQL queries on VDBs. The nature of the Teiid Virtual Database allows complex, multi-source
          modeling and data transformation, so you can design views targeted for your front-end applications and simplify or reduce
          the work necessary to pull all that data together.</p>

      <td valign="top">
          <p><strong>Teiid Designer 7.1</strong> supports generation of deployable web service War Files. 
          For VDB's that contain web service models, there is a contextual menu 
option to generate a JBossWS-CXF war. This generated war can be deployed to 
a JBossAS server with CXF enabled. The wizard will ask for a war context name, 
target namespace, JNDI name for the deployed Teiid VDB, and location to generate 
the war file. Once deployed, the wsdl can be obtained via <b><i>http://host:port/warContextName?wsdl</i></b></p>
