<h1>ModeShape 7.1.0 M2 What's New</h1>
<p align="right"><a href="../index.html">&lt; Main Index</a></p>
<p>Last revised September 1, 2010</p>
<p>The ModeShape publishing feature, which is new to JBoss Tools, enables you to publish files to (upload) and unpublish files from (remove) ModeShape repositories.
Once files are uploaded to a ModeShaper repository, the appropriate ModeShape sequencers will extract and add information, such as relationships and metadata.
For more details on the ModeShape project visit the <a href="http://www.modeshape.org/">ModeShape project</a>.
<p>The ModeShape publishing feature consists of a ModeShape view, resource context menu, publishing wizard, preference dialog, and a Console view.
Each of these are briefly discussed below.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" align="left">
      <p>
      	<b>ModeShape View</b>
      </p>
    </td>

      <td valign="top">
      	<p>
      	The ModeShape view allows you to register ModeShape instances using a host URL, user, and password. A ModeShape instance 
      	is a host that is running the ModeShape REST service. Once a ModeShape instance is registered, the ModeShape view obtains 
      	the repositories and repository workspaces from ModeShape. These workspaces are where you can publish your files. This 
      	view also allows you to unpublish files from a workspace in case you ever need to do that. Using the ModeShape view you 
      	can unregister (remove) a ModeShape instance, reconnect to a ModeShape instance, and edit a ModeShape instance's 
      	properties. The ModeShape view quite simply is how you maintain your registry of ModeShape repositories. And the 
      	ModeShape registry is persisted from session to session.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      	Here is what the ModeShape view looks like:

      	</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" align="left">
	  <p>
	  <b>Resource Context Menu</b>
	  </p>
	</td>

    <td valign="top">
    	<p>
    	Once you have one or more ModeShape instances registered, you can now start publishing files. When you select one or 
    	more projects, folders, or files in your Eclipse workspace, the context menu for those files will include a ModeShape 
    	submenu that allows you to publish or unpublish those resources. If only one resource is selected you can also view the 
    	locations where that resource has been published. When you publish or unpublish the files, the publishing wizard is 
    	displayed.
    	</p>

      	<p>
      	Here is what the ModeShape resource context menu looks like:
      	</p>
      	
      	<p>
      	<img src="images/ResourceContextMenu.png" alt="ModeShape Resource Context Menu"/>
      	</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr>
  <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">
      	<p>
      	<b>Publishing Wizard</b>
      	</p>
      </td>

      <td valign="top">
      	<p>
      	The publishing wizard allows you to choose which ModeShape repository workspace you want the operation to take place. 
      	It also lists the files that will be involved in the operation. When a project or folder is selected all their included 
      	files are published. But there might be certain folder names and certain file types that you never want to publish. 
      	Wouldn't it be nice to filter those out of all your publishing operations? The ModeShape preferences dialog helps you do 
      	just that.
      	</p>

      	<p>
      	Here is what the ModeShape publishing wizard looks like:
      	</p>
      	
      	<p>
      	<img src="images/PublishDialog.png" alt="ModeShape Publishing Wizard"/>
      	</p>

  <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">
	    <p>
	    <b>Preference Dialog</b>
	    </p>
	  </td>

      <td valign="top">
      	<p>
      	The preferences dialog is where you maintain a list of file extensions and a list of folder names to filter out of 
      	your publishing operations. These can be changed at any time and will be remembered from session to session. For each 
      	file that does get published or unpublished you can see the outcome using the console view.
      	</p>
 
      	<p>
      	Here is what the ModeShape preference dialog looks like:
      	</p>
      	
      	<p>
      	<img src="images/ModeShapePreferencesDialog.png" alt="ModeShape Preferences Dialog"/>
      	</p>
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><hr /></td></tr>
  <tr>
      <td valign="top" align="left">
	      <p>
	      <b>ModeShape Console View</b>
	      </p>
	  </td>

      <td valign="top">
	      <p>
	      The ModeShape console view is where publishing and unpublishing operations direct their output. In the console view you 
	      will see where the publishing operation took place, how long the operation took, and the outcome for each file included in 
	      the operation. You can run these operations in the background so you can have many running at once. You can also cancel an 
	      operation while it is processing. For each file, a hyperlink, which allows you to open the file in an Eclipse editor, and 
	      a ModeShape repository workspace URL is provided.
	      </p>
