    <td valign="top">
      <p>This plugin is the first in enabling Seam for Eclipse
      projects. Currently there are two ways to enable it, use the
      Seam Web Project Wizard and have a basic Seam Web project be
      ready with Seam support or enable it on existing projects by
      right clicking on the project and choose "Enable/Disable Seam
      support"</p>

	<p><img src="enableseam.png"/></p>

	    <p>Seam support on projects does *not* require your
	    eclipse project to be a WTP project, it can be a plain old
	    Eclipse project (e.g. generated by Seam's seam-gen).</p>

	  <p>In practice enabling "Seam support" on your project
	  installs the Seam Eclipse builder on your project which will scan your
	  project for Seam artifacts (annotations, component.xml,
	  seam.properties, etc.) to provide the various features.</p>

      <p>The size of the list can be quite daunting so you can filter
the content to ignore components only defined in jar's.  This will
hide the many built-in Seam components and leave only those left that
are actually defined in the project or have actively configured via
components.xml</p>

      is also avaible as a node in the built-in "Project Explorer"
      (not "Package Explorer") view in Eclipse.</p>

      <p>Validation of various possible problematic definitions in Seam applications have been implemented. If an issue is found it will show up in the standard "Problems View".</p>

	your project and click "Validate" which will execute all the
	WTP validations active on your project</p>

	  <p>On WTP projects it is by default executed automatically,
	  but on normal Java projects you will have to go and enable
	  the Validation builder on your project . It is available in
	  the properties of your project under "Validation".</p>

      <p><img src="seamvalidation.png"></p>

      <p>Instead of using the Seam Wizards (which generates WTP projects) some users prefer to use the seam-gen tool provided by Seam more directly. 
	<p>Furthermore not all seam-gen provided functionallity is
available in the Seam Wizards just yet, so for that we currently
provide a Seam-Gen menu that is merely a wrapper around the seam-gen
build.xml script - hence this menu does *exactly* what seam-gen does;
nothing more and nothing less (except for automatically register the
project and database connection in Eclipse - but that's it).</p>
