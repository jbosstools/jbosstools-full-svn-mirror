    <p>
    Now JBoss Tools supports discovering and debugging remote Java
      applications running on an hotspot enabled JVM.
	</p>

      <p>This feature allows you to connect the Eclipse Java Debugger
      to any running Java application without having to configure
      Eclipse to use the right port and source attachements. This
      feature will do that work for you, making it super easy to
      remote debug any java application with full source navigation in
      your loaded Eclipse projects.</p>
      
	<p>
        To use it you right-click one or more Java projects in the workspace and call 
	an action to discover Remote Java applications started in the debug mode.
	</p>

       <p><i>Note: To be able to detect these remote applications you need classes in the package
      <code>sun.jvmstat.monitor.*</code> which are only provided by
      Sun/Oracle based JVM's like the standard JVM/JDK and
      OpenJDK. The feature should work on all common JDK
      distributions but if you use some custom JDK distribution it
      might not work. For OSX these classes are included in the normal
      JavaVM, but on other operating systems you will need to ensure
      a full JDK with tools.jar is used when running Eclipse.</i></p>
      
    <p>
    The selection of projects is important since it tells JBoss Tools
      which projects you wish to have added as source projects for the
      remote Java application.
      </p>

      <p>Once you select "Remote Java Application..." the scanning
    commmences, normally this should go fast but if you have alot of
    java applications or one of them are waiting for a debugger to
    attach the search can take a while. Eventually, if there are remote Java applications on your localhost, a dialog as shown below will appear:
    </p>
    <img src="images/remote-debugging2.png" />
    <p>
    In this case the application with PID 4964 is started with the
    'suspend=y' option. In this case, JDK can determine only the
    application's PID and port and not any info about class and
    arguments (because the JVM is suspended/not fully started).
    
    </p>
    <p>
    In the bottom of the dialog a combobox allowing you to choose
    between Configurations are shown. JBoss Tools will create one
    automatically based on the selection but if you have some
    customization you wish to you can do that and just ensure the
    "JBoss Remote configuration" preference is checked on your own
    custom launch configuration
    </p>

      <p>If that preference is set, it will be included in the list of
    possible Configurations and every setting beyond the host/port
    numbers will be reused. This allow you to customize your launch
    configurations as you wish to for repeated launches.</p>

    <p>
    The JBoss Remote Java Application supports the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discovers remote applications running on the local host (not external hosts)</li>
    <li>all selected projects will be included in the source
    attachment for the project</li>
    <li>if you have m2e installed, Maven dependencies for all the selected projects will be resolved
     and included in the source attachment 
     (m2e supports this functionality only for Java application, JUnit and TestNG launch configurations)</li>
    <li>The user can create Remote Java Application launch configurations containing user specific source attachments</li>
    </ul>
