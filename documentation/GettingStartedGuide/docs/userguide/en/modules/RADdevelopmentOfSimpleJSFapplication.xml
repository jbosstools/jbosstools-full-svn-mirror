	<title>RAD development of a simple JSF application</title>
        <para>In this chapter you will see how to create a simple JSF application being based on <property>&quot;RAD&quot;</property> philosophy. We will develop an application simulating a game of Craps. The user will &quot;roll&quot; two dice by entering two numbers and clicking two buttons and the program will announce if the user won or not depending on the program&apos;s logic.</para>
      <para>We&apos;ll show you how to create such an application from scratch, along the way demonstrating powerful features of Red Hat Developer Studio such as project templating, Visual Page Editor, code completion and others. You will design the
JSF application and then run the application from inside Red Hat Developer Studio using the bundled JBoss server.</para>
