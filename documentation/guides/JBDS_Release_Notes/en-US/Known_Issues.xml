					When JAX-RS services are tested through JAX-RS Tooling and Web Service Tester integration, the URL of the service can include details about required parameters. If the included parameters require values to be specified, a dialog prompting for these values now appears to the user and validation of the values occurs if the service includes a Regular Expression. This new feature ensures all values are gathered and verified before testing the service, minimizing returned errors.
