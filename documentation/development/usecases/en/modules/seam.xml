    <title>Overall Seam interaction</title>

    <para>The following scenario should be as smooth as possible and work for
    both WAR and EAR.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">New Seam Web Project</emphasis></para>

        <para>Ask user the minimal set of questions to make this work.</para>

        <para>Sensible defaults should be used to minimize the need for users
        to do anything</para>

        <para>After finish is pressed one or more eclipse projects are created
        and linked together correctly.</para>

        <para>The project(s) should after this be deployable to an already
        chosen server and testable! (for both EAR and WAR)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Run tests</emphasis></para>

        <para>There won't be any tests initially, but the initial setup should
        be ready.</para>

        <para>This should run the microcontainer/embedded jboss just as
        seam-gen does.</para>

        <para>Remember that the driver jar(s) needs to be available to this
        project for the database related applications to run.</para>

        <para>It also needs custom persistence.xml and other files to work
        correctly. See seam-gen for the differences.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Deploy and run project</emphasis></para>

        <para>Run &gt; Run As ... &gt; Run On Server should deploy to already
        chosen server and show the main page.</para>

        <para>If you choose Run On Server while having a .xhtml file
        open/selected the browser should optimally open the corresponding
        resource (e.g. login.xhtml -&gt; login.seam)</para>

        <para>Debug &gt; Debug As ... &gt; Debug On Server should deploy to
        already chosen server and show the main page.</para>

        <para>Go to browser and click login, fill in user and password with
        "max"/"max", click Login</para>

        <para>Page should should show "max" as logged in, click Logout, page
        should now show max is logged out.</para>

        <para>Put a breakpoint in Authenticator.java on the line with
        log.info("authenticating #0", identity.getUsername());</para>

        <para>Go to browser and click login, fill in user and password with
        "max"/"max", click Login</para>

        <para>Eclipse should now stop at the breakpoint with the source
        already loaded and configured (no need to add project src to the
        launch config)</para>

        <para>Change the method to only let users with different user/password
        in and put a message about the error:</para>

        <para></para>

        <programlisting>public boolean authenticate()
    {
        log.info("authenticating #0", identity.getUsername());
        if(identity.getUsername().equals(identity.getPassword())) {

         return false;
        }
        identity.addRole("admin");
        return true;
    }</programlisting>

        <para>Press save, and eclipse's hotswap should be in effect.</para>

        <para>Click continue and the browser should complain that the user
        could not log in and show the message "Sorry - password and username
        need to be different." plus a Login Failed message.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Edit an xhtml or another "web resource"
        like html, css etc. and save, refresh browser should work
        instantly</emphasis></para>

        <para>Edit login.xhtml, add some text in the main paragraph. Save, go
        to browser and press refresh - changes should be there.</para>

        <para>On save the file should be instantly available so users does not
        have to wait for it. (WTP has a 5 second default delay; can we make
        that better ?)</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Edit or add a java class should be
        available after clicking "Restart app"</emphasis></para>

        server; just the application.(With seam hotdeploy (requires Seam
        1.2.1) classes in META-INF/dev is automatically hotdeployed)</para>

        <para>JBoss allows touching of descriptors to trigger restart. See
        seam-gen on how it is done technically.</para>

        <para>Old exadel studio had a "touch web.xml" file; not sure if that

    <title>Seam New Project</title>

    <para>New Seam Web Project should be as quickly done as possible and when
    it is done the user should be asked to go to the Seam perspective (or the
    JEE perspective should have Seam relevant views added).</para>

    <para>(I am not sure if we should have a dedicated wizard that just shows
    the minimal set of options and does not provide all the WTP options,
    ...but we should work with both so using the normal wizard is probably the
    best start)</para>

    <para>There should be support for two types of projects: EAR and WAR. Each
    setup would require more than one project to work in eclipse and it would
    probably make sense to define a working set that defines the Seam Project.
    e.g. working set called "SeamPhoto" for a project called "SeamPhoto" and
    the corresponding projects would be named "seamphoto", "seamphoto.ejb",
    "seamphoto.ear", "seamphoto.test" (this names are *defaults* and our code
    should not depend on the naming pattern to figure out what kind a project
    is)</para>

    <para>The best way to see what should go where is to use seam-gen to
    generate two projects, one for war and the other for ear - when built
    exploded-archives will contain the .ear/.war/.jar with the libs needed in
    the various places. the only thing not done by seam-gen is the seperation
    of the test code/libs.</para>

    <para>I've added a projectexample dir next to this document that has an
    working EAR project structure including test project. Note this layout is
    just an example of what works - I have e.g. not verifed that all relevant
    libs are included, just that it runs with the basic setup.</para>

    <section>
      <title>War</title>

      <para>A WAR project can only use Seam JavaBean and JPA Entity bean
      components; it cannot use EJB3 Session beans etc. This means that Action
      generation should by default generate JavaBean components and not EJB3
      components when it is run against a WAR project.</para>

      <para>A WAR project can in Seam 1.2.1.GA (not Seam 1.2.0.EAP) support
      hotdeployment of classes put in WEB-INF/classes/dev (see seam-gen for
      details), action classes are normally put there.</para>

      <para>To run unittests we probably need a &lt;projectname&gt;-test
      project that depends on the war project and contains the jars/resources
      to run tests.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Ear</title>

      <para>An EAR project can use the whole range of Seam components,
      including EJB3 Session beans. Action's should by default generate EJB3
      components</para>

      <para>To run unittests we probably need a &lt;projectname&gt;-test
      project that depends on the war project and contains the jars/resources
      to run tests.</para>

      <para>Both the war, utility-jar and test project should be marked as a
      Seam project.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Exploded Deployment</title>

      <para>JBoss exploded deployment works by having the archives exploded
      (meaning unzipped) into the deploy directory.</para>

      <para>We need to make sure this actually works - also with how WTP
      deploys the EAR's. e.g. does WTP/our adapter deploy the WAR just like
      seam-gen projects does ?</para>

      <para></para>

      <para>e.g. the EAR contains the WAR and JAR:</para>

      <para>This will work:</para>

      <programlisting>myproject.ear/
  META-INF/application.xml
  myproject.war/
      WEB-INF/web.xml
  myproject.jar/
      META-INF/persistence.xml
</programlisting>

      <para>This will probably not work (all projects side-by-side):</para>

      <programlisting>myproject.ear/
  META-INF/application.xml
myproject.war/
  WEB-INF/web.xml
myproject.jar/
  META-INF/persistence.xml
</programlisting>

      <para></para>

      <section>
        <title>Hot-restart/touch</title>

        <para>Doing hot restart is just a matter of touching the descriptors.
        This is from seam-gen:</para>

        <para>For EAR:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;target name="restart" depends="explode" description="Restart the exploded archive"&gt;
  &lt;touch file="${ear.deploy.dir}/META-INF/application.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>For WAR:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;target name="restart" depends="explode" description="Restart the exploded archive"&gt;
  &lt;touch file="${war.deploy.dir}/WEB-INF/web.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</programlisting>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Libraries/Runtime environment</title>

      <para>A project should be associated with a Seam runtime which defines
      what version (1.2 or 2.0) the IDE should assume for the project + the
      set of core libraries for seam (just derived from the homedir). Exactly
      like one does for JDK runtimes.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>End Result</title>

      <para>No warnings or errors in the project from any of our
      validators.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Seam Generate Entities</title>

    <para>Generate entities is in seam-gen is always reverse engineering from
    the database and based on that a set of JPA entities are created and
    corresponding CRUD pages and action classes generated. See seam-gen for
    the details.</para>

    <para>We should have a Generate Entities that allows exactly this, but
    optimally also allows you to use your existing JPA entities as the basis
    of the CRUD generation. Hibernate Tools can handle this today if it is
    just told not to do reverse engineering; it will then just use all the
    entities it can find on the classpath.</para>

    <para>If we create a Hibernate Tools code generation users will have it
    available in the Run &gt; Hibernate Code Generation and be able to run it
    repeatedly.</para>

    <para>Next to this document is a hsqldb folder with a hsqldb with data
    that can be used with Seam Generate Entities to have a fully working
    application.</para>
