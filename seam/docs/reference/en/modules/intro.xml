    <para><property>Seam</property> is a fully featured application framework on top of Java EE 5. It is also one of the most popular enterprise Java framework today. Seam deeply integrates many other
        standard-based or open source frameworks (e.g., JSF, EJB3, JMS, Web Services, jBPM, JBoss Rules, Ajax4jsf, RichFaces, Facelets, Spring, iText, Quartz, TestNG, etc.), and
        provides a single programming model for developers to &quot;drive&quot; those underlying frameworks via simple annotated POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). It makes life easier
        for developers to tackle complex enterprise applications with many component frameworks.</para>
