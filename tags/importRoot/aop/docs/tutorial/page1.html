<body>

<b>Synopsis</b>
<hr/>
This tutorial is meant to guide you through creating a new AOP project in eclipse using the AOP extension to JBossIDE. It assumes that you have some working
knowledge of AOP, and Java.. and possibly some minimal experience dealing with eclipse as well.
<br/><br/>

<b>JBossIDE/AOP pre-resequites</b>
<hr/>
Before you install JBossIDE/AOP you'll need Eclipse 3.0 (a late RC might work, though it hasn't been tested) and JBossIDE.
<br/><br/>

<b>Installing via the update site (recommended)</b>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li> The easiest way to install the AOP extension is to select Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Find and Install in the Eclipse workbench.</li>
<li> In the wizard that opens, click on the "Search for new features to install" radio button, and click Next.</li>
<li> On the next page you will need to add a new update site for JBossIDE. Click the "New Remote Site.." button.</li>
<li> Type in "JBossIDE" for the name, and "http://jboss.sourceforge.net/jbosside/updates" for the URL, and click OK.</li>
<li> You should see a new site in the list now called JBossIDE. click the "+" sign next to it to show the platforms available.</li>
<li> If you don't have JBossIDE installed, check the "JBoss-IDE 1.0/Eclipse 3.0" checkbox.</li>
<li>Check the "JBoss-IDE AOP Extension" checkbox.</li>
<li> In the feature list you should check the "JBoss-IDE AOP Extension 0.9" checkbox, and the JBoss-IDE (1.3.30) checkbox if you don't have JBossIDE installed. </li>
<li> At this point you should only need to accept the license agreement(s) and wait for the install process to finish.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<b>Installing via zip files (sourceforge) </b>
<hr/>
Extract the contents of the jbosside-aop.zip file into your eclipse root folder (on my system, this is C:\Apps\eclipse).
If Eclipse is running when you extracted the zip file, make sure to restart Eclipse so it recognizes the plugin.
