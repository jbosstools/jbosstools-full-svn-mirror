 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
The Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology is a standard part of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE platform). The JMX technology was added to the platform in the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0 release.
</diffmk:wrapper></para>
 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
The JMX technology provides a simple, standard way of managing resources such as applications, devices, and services. Because the JMX technology is dynamic, you can use it to monitor and manage resources as they are created, installed and implemented. You can also use the JMX technology to monitor and manage the Java Virtual Machine (Java VM).
</diffmk:wrapper></para>
 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
The JMX specification defines the architecture, design patterns, APIs, and services in the Java programming language for management and monitoring of applications and networks.
</diffmk:wrapper></para>
 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
Using the JMX technology, a given resource is instrumented by one or more Java objects known as Managed Beans, or MBeans. These MBeans are registered in a core-managed object server, known as an MBean server. The MBean server acts as a management agent and can run on most devices that have been enabled for the Java programming language. 
</diffmk:wrapper></para>
 
 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
The specifications define JMX agents that you use to manage any resources that have been correctly configured for management. A JMX agent consists of an MBean server, in which MBeans are registered, and a set of services for handling the MBeans. In this way, JMX agents directly control resources and make them available to remote management applications.
</diffmk:wrapper></para>
 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
The way in which resources are instrumented is completely independent from the management infrastructure. Resources can therefore be rendered manageable regardless of how their management applications are implemented.
</diffmk:wrapper></para>
 <para diffmk:change="added"><diffmk:wrapper diffmk:change="added">
The JMX technology defines standard connectors (known as JMX connectors) that enable you to access JMX agents from remote management applications. JMX connectors using different protocols provide the same management interface. Consequently, a management application can manage resources transparently, regardless of the communication protocol used. JMX agents can also be used by systems or applications that are not compliant with the JMX specification, as long as those systems or applications support JMX agents.

                port. JBoss, for example, requires setting some credentials on the client machine, but
                using JBoss classes to do it. This requires that the connection have access to JBoss

        <title>Connections Creation Task</title>
        
        <para>The <property moreinfo="none">MBean Explorer</property> supports several different types of connections. 
            The tooling itself comes only with a default connection type, however other
            adopters can provide additional connection types that may require additional
            or non-spec behavior. Connections can be in either the connected state or
            the disconnected state. Some connection types (such as the default connection type)
            allow you to control the current state. Other connection types may not. </para>
        
        <para>Similarly, some connection types may be able to be created, and others may not. 
            The default connection type, for example, can be created and deleted by you
            at will. The AS Tools connection type, which represents a JBoss server, does not
            allow you this level of control. A JBoss JMX connection is created when a JBoss server is created
            in the server's view, and deleted when said server is deleted. The JMX connection for 
            this server is in the connected state only when the server is started. </para>

        <title>MBean Explorer</title>
        <para>The <property moreinfo="none">MBean Explorer</property> displays the MBean features (both attributes and operations) in its
            hierarchy. Double-clicking on a feature will open a <property moreinfo="none">MBean Editor</property>, display the page
            corresponding to the feature type and select the feature.</para>

        <para>Since it's possible to have many MBean Editors opened at the same time, the <property moreinfo="none">MBean Explorer</property>
            has the Link With Editor button

            to synchronize selections between the active <property moreinfo="none">MBean Editor</property> and
            the <property moreinfo="none">MBean Explorer</property> (and vice versa).</para>
        
        <para>The <property moreinfo="none">MBean Explorer</property> has also a filter text that can be used to filter among all the MBeans
            the few ones, which interest you.</para>
        
        <para>For example, if you are only interested by MBeans related to memory, typing memo will show
            any node (domain, mbean, attribute, or operation) that matches that text, as well as 
            that node's parents and children. So if an MBean matches, all attributes and operations from 
            that bean will show.  If, however, an attribute or operation name (a leaf node) matches, 
            only that node and its parents in the tree will show.</para>
