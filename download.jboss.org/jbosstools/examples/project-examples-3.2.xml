		<description>
		This is a simple Teiid Designer model project that demonstrates how a view model can be used to create a virtual 
		relational table that joins multiple physical relational tables. The project also contains a Virtual Database (VDB) which
		contains the project's models, and in a runtime environment, would also contain the needed connection information for the
		physical sources. VDBs are used by Teiid to access federated data.
