JRebel's license prevents us from redistributing it, but we ARE allowed to link to it provided that
a) we don't host the bits and
b) we ensure the license terms are accepted prior to installation.

This site (in composite/ folder) is here to allow both the JRebel bits and its upstream WTP 
dependencies to be located at a single URL, because Mylyn Discovery (JBoss Central) can only 
source bits from one URL per connector. Therefore this composite allows us to install provide
JRebel AND its dependencies via a single connector.
