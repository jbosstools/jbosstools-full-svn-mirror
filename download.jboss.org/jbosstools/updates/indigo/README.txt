Instead of mirroring Helios here, composite a site here from:

* /updates/requirements/indigo/
* /updates/requirements/orbit/
* /updates/requirements/gwt/
* BIRT 4.0 site @ eclipse.org

See /updates/requirements/indigo/README.txt for how to mirror from eclipse.org to here.
See /updates/requirements/gwt/build.xml for how to mirror from google.com to here.
