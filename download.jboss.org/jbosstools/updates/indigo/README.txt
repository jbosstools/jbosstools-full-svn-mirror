Instead of mirroring Helios here, composite a site here from:

* /updates/requirements/indigo/
* /updates/requirements/orbit/
* /updates/requirements/gwt/
* /updates/requirements/swtbot/2.0.3/
* /updates/requirements/birt/4.0/

See /updates/requirements/indigo/README.txt for how to mirror from eclipse.org to here.
See /updates/requirements/{gwt,swtbot,birt}/build.xml for how to mirror other sites.
