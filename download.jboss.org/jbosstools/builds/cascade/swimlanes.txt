Last updated 2012/09/22

------------------------

New in 4.0 (Core):

New component hierarchy/organization (after migration to git):

https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12356997/Components-And-Groups-Final.png
	(Note: maven/examples/central to be combined into a single job)

* migration to git: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-12475

* deltacloud [removed]

* runtime no longer depends on as, seam

New in 4.0 (SOA Tooling):

* Flow/jbpm4/jpdl4 removed. See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-12631

After migration, job flows will be:

1. CME {central/maven/examples} -> JavaEE {portlet/seam/jsf/vpe/jst, cdi/jst, struts/vpe/jst} -> xulrunner, Base 
2. Persistence {birt/hibernate}, Server, gwt, forge, freemarker,  -> Base
	(Persistence, Server, gwt, forge, and freemarker all depend on Base)
	(Persistence is composed of birt depending on hibernate)
3. ws, openshift -> Server {as/archives, as/jmx} -> Base {common, runtime, tests, usage}
	(both ws and openshift depend on Server, which depends on Base)
	(Server is composed of as depending on archives and on jmx)
	(Base is composed of common, runtime, tests, and usage)
