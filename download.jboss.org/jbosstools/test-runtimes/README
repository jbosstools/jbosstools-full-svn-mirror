This folder is aimed at containing runtimes that are necessary
for test execution, retrieved by maven-download-plugin, and that
are specific to JBT/JBDS and then not available anywhere else.

All requirements that are available at a public URL are
downloaded from there.

This location contains stuff we use only for JBT/JBDS tests.

See https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-11714
