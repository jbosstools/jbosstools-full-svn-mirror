  <title>Runtimes and Servers in the JBoss AS plugin</title>

  <para>In this chapter we will discuss how to install runtimes and servers.</para>

  <para>First of all it's necessary to mention that the JBoss AS plugin makes use of WTP.
    This includes starting and stopping servers in run or debug mode. It also includes targeting WTP
    projects, such as Dynamic Web Projects, to certain server runtimes in order to ensure that the
    proper jars from a specific server are added to the project's classpath properly.</para>
  <para>In order to get started creating, running, and debugging J2EE applications, we should create
    our <property moreinfo="none">runtime</property> and <property moreinfo="none">server</property> instances.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Runtimes</title>
    <para>In JBoss Tools, the main purpose of Server Runtimes is to point to a server installation
      somewhere on disk. In our case, this will be a JBoss installation, and it can then be used for
      two primary purposes:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>it provides classpath additions to WTP projects that require them.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>for <property moreinfo="none">JBoss server</property> at least, it provides information necessary for
          the starting and stopping of the server, it tells which jars to run and which
          configuration to use.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="InstNewRuntime">
      <title>Installing a new Runtime</title>
      <para>You can install runtimes into eclipse from the <emphasis>
          <property moreinfo="none">Window &gt; Preferences... </property>
        </emphasis> menu, and then select <emphasis>
          <property moreinfo="none">Server &gt; Installed Runtimes</property>
        </emphasis> from the categories available.</para>
      <figure float="0">

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>From this preference page you can see all declared runtimes and their types as well.
        Figure above shows two declared runtimes that include a JBoss 4.2 instance. Here,
        it's possible to edit or remove existing runtimes as well as add a new one.</para>

      <para>To create a JBoss runtime click <emphasis>
          <property moreinfo="none">Add</property>
        </emphasis> button and choose a necessary type of runtime from the appeared dialog. </para>

      </figure>

      <para>As you can see, <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Tools</property> provide its own adapters such as JBoss
        3.2, 4.0, 4.2 and 5.0 as well. The last one comes with its own new feature, that is a safer
        incremental deployment, which prevents partial deployments to be picked up by the server. It
        means that scanning for auto-deployment is suspended while files are being copied to the
        deployment location and resumed when the copy is completed.</para>
      
      <note>
        <title>Note:</title>
        <para>Currently we recommend you to use a fully supported JBoss 4.2 server adapter.</para>
      </note>

      <para>You'll also note a Deploy-Only Runtime type. This type provides no classpath
        for WTP projects. It is used solely by its server type for the purpose of setting up a
        deploy directory for users who don't wish to make use of starting, stopping, or
        debugging their projects inside eclipse.</para>

                  configuration-specific jboss jars and create their own configuration. Thus, rather
                  than forcing you to copy his entire JBoss installation, the structure of the
                  wizard allows to create only a new configuration instead.</para>

                <para>The list of configurations (all, default, minimal) that is updated as soon as
                  you browse to a valid runtime installation folder. After the runtime is created
                  the configuration becomes an unchanging property of that runtime. To compile
                  against a different configuration's jars, you will need to create a new runtime
                  from that configuration.</para>

          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>

      <para>As a result of having each runtime represent a specific configuration rather than the
        server installation as a whole, it is very likely you'll create several different
        runtimes to test each of your configurations. It becomes important to ensure your runtimes,
        and later your servers, are given descriptive names that help you remember which is which.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Servers</title>
    <para>WTP servers are eclipse-representations of a backing server installation. They are used to
      start or stop servers, deploy to servers, or debug code that will run on the server. They keep
      track of the modules (jars, wars, etc) you deploy to the server and also allow you to undeploy
      those modules (see <link linkend="run_on_server_wizard">Deploying with Run On Server
      Wizard</link> section). </para>
    <para>Servers can be started or stopped with different <link linkend="com_line_arg">command-line
        arguments</link>. They are often backed by a runtime object representing that server's

      <title>Creating a New Server</title>
      
      <para>There are many ways to get to the new server wizard. One way is to use the old standard <emphasis>
          <property moreinfo="none">File &gt; New &gt; Other... </property>
        </emphasis> and then <emphasis>
          <property moreinfo="none">Server</property>
        </emphasis>. This should show the wizard like below.</para>

      <para>A server object is that keeps track of things like command line arguments when starting
        or stopping, and runtimes keep track of the location of the installation. Thus, each server
        instance must be backed by an appropriate runtime. </para>

      <para>From the list of already declared runtimes in the combo box below the view it's
        possible to select which runtime you want your server to be backed by. If there is no
        runtime that matches your needs just press <emphasis>
          <property moreinfo="none">Installed Runtimes... </property>
        </emphasis> to bring up the familiar preference page like in <link linkend="InstNewRuntime">
          the previous section</link>. Here, it becomes possible to edit already existing runtime or
        add a new one with necessary configuration.</para>

      <para>In this case the next page in the wizard which has the same form as in <link linkend="add_runtime_figure">the previous section</link> will ask you to create the
        associated runtime.</para>
      <para>Either way, after targeting your server to a runtime, the final screen in this wizard is
        largely confirmational, giving you a chance to verify that you've selected the
        appropriate runtime. It also allows to name the server appropriately. </para>

<chapter id="webtools" xml:base="file:///home/ochikvina/WORK/for_compare/trunk/as/docs/reference/en/modules/webtools.xml">
	<title>Projects</title>
	<para>The most popular of the projects we deal with are the J2EE ones, such as Dynamic Web
		Project, EJB Project, or EAR project. Web projects of <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Tools</property> are
		Struts, JSF and Seam projects. All of them are called faceted projects. Thus, in this
		chapter we are going to tell you about facets the main benefit of which to provide proper
		structuring and packaging for any type of project.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Faceted Projects Overview</title>
		<para>The idea behind faceted projects is that each project can accept units of
			functionality, or facets, which can be added or removed by the user. Most often, these
			facets either add to the project's classpath, enable a builder, or watch the project in
			some other fashion. Generally, every project concerned has at least one facet when
			it's created. As an example, a Web project has a WebDoclet facet, or an EJB
			Project has an EJB Module facet as prerequisites.</para>

		<para> WTP projects have undergone some criticism as being
			<emphasis>over-engineered</emphasis> or too restrictive in their design. WTP projects
			are set up in a tree-relationship to each other, where one project can be a child of
			another. For example, an EAR project may have a Web Project child, an EJB project child,
			or other types.</para>

		<para> However, the benefit of this is that the structure of your projects is then known,
			and packaging it up *should* be trivial. Apparently, if your project is non-standard, or
			you feel too confined by such rigid structural requirements, you can still choose to
			package your project using the <link linkend="Project_archivesView">Archives
			plugin</link>.</para>
	</section>


	<section>
		<title>Adding Facets to a Project</title>

		<para>In this section we're going to consider the facets added by <property moreinfo="none">JBoss
				Tools</property> and show how you can configure them in a project: add new ones or
			modify already existing configuration of the facets.</para>

		<para>One way to configure the facets is doing it while organizing a new project. To
			demonstrate this let's create a new <property moreinfo="none">Dynamic Web Project</property> by
			selecting <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">File &gt; New &gt; Other...</property>
			</emphasis> and then <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">Web &gt; Dynamic Web Project</property>. </emphasis></para>

		</figure>
		<para>Click <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">Next</property>
			</emphasis> and you will see Dynamic Web Project page like on the figure below.</para>

		<para> The first page of most WTP projects allows you to target a specific runtime,
			representing a server's library location. It will also provide you the ability to add
			this project to an EAR project, and select a pre-selected default set of facets, called
			a configuration, rather than manually select each facet you might want.</para>
		<para> Selecting the runtime, again, allows the project to install the proper classpaths to
			the project so it knows what code to compile against.</para>

			follows.</para>

		</figure>

		<para>Here part of the listed facets are those which are provided by WTP. Some of them are
			added by <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Tools</property>. They are:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>BIRT Charting Runtime Component</para>

		<para>On this wizard page you can enable or disable any facet as well as change it version.
			What you should note here is that some facets or facets versions may conflict with each
			other. In case of incompatibility you'll be prompted about this in the combo
			box underneath.</para>

		<para>Clicking on <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">OK</property>
			</emphasis> will save the chosen configuration of the facets and return you to the <link linkend="dyn_web_project">Dynamic Web Project wizard</link>. Further pages in the
			wizard are specific to either the project type or the facets selected.</para>


		<para>If you need to configure the facets for the existing project, you should bring up the
			context menu for selected project and click <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">Properties</property>
			</emphasis> and then <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">Project Facets</property>. </emphasis> This will bring up the familiar

	<title>Deploying Modules</title>

	<para>In this chapter it will be described how to deploy modules onto the server.</para>
	<para> First of all it is necessary to say that deploying to a server is mostly painless. There
		are several ways to do it provided by WTP, and some additional methods provided by JBoss
		Tools. These methods are described further in this chapter.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Deploying on the Package Explorer</title>

		<para>On the package explorer it is possible to publish either a project to a server or just
			a signal file. Let's look at how to do this.</para>
		<section id="run_on_server_wizard">
			<title>Deploying with Run On Server Wizard</title>
			<para> The first WTP method is to right-click on a project, such as a Dynamic Web
				project, EJB project, or EAR project and then select <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Run As &gt; Run on Server</property>
				</emphasis>. The resulting dialog allows you to select which supporting server the
				project can be published to.</para>
			<figure float="0">
				<title>Define a New Server</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/modules/modules_1.png"></imagedata>
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>Click <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Next</property>
				</emphasis> button to see add or remove projects page where you can choose projects
				to configure them on server.</para>
			<figure float="0" id="add_rem_proj">
				<title>Add or Remove Projects</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/modules/modules_2.png"></imagedata>
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			<para>This page of the wizard also allows to undeploy modules from the server. For that
				choose proper module(s) from the right and click <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none"> &lt; Remove</property>
				</emphasis>. The modules will be completely undeployed after restarting your server
				or republishing.</para>
			<para>Generally, for the JBoss AS Server Adapters, publishing using this method will
				force a default, best-guess, packaging configuration for your project. This
				best-guess does not publish incrementally, but instead repackages your entire
				project into a <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">.war</property>
				</emphasis>, <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">.jar</property>
				</emphasis>, or <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">.ear</property>
				</emphasis> as appropriate, and then copies that file into the proper deploy
				directory. For quicker smarter deployment, you will need to create archives using
				the <link linkend="Project_archivesView">Project Archives view</link> and customize
				packaging yourself.</para>
		</section>

		<section id="single_file_deployment">
			<?dbhtml filename="DeployToServer.html"?>
			<title>Deploying single files</title>

			<para>Sometimes it becomes necessary to deploy one or more files to a server. For
				that in order not to do a full republish in the context menu of files a <emphasis><property moreinfo="none">Deploy To Server</property></emphasis>
				option is provided that allows a single file deployment. To deploy these non-WTP files/projects
				right click on the file (<emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">-ds.xml</property></emphasis>, <emphasis>
						<property moreinfo="none">.ear</property></emphasis>, <emphasis>
							<property moreinfo="none">.jar</property></emphasis> etc.) and select <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Deploy To Server</property>
				</emphasis> and it will be automatically deployed.</para>

			<para>The deployed files are listed side-by-side with other modules that are deployed to
			the server.</para>

	<section>
		<title>Deploying with JBoss Server View</title>
		<para>As it has been already mentioned <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Server View</property> contains two
			parts: the top part that displays all defined servers and the bottom part which provides
			categories with additional information. Thus, in this section we suggest two more ways
			to deploy resources onto the server.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Top part of JBoss Server View</title>
			<para>In the top part of the <property moreinfo="none">JBoss Servers View</property> like in the Servers
				View you should right click on a server and select the <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Add and Remove Projects</property>
				</emphasis> menu item.</para>
			<figure float="0">
				<title>Add and Remove Projects</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/modules/modules_3.png"></imagedata>
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>

			<para>This will bring up a <link linkend="add_rem_proj">familiar dialog</link> allowing
				you to either publish projects or modules to a server, or remove them from the
				server. If the selected module is a project like a Dynamic Web project, EJB project,
				or EAR project, it will be published as through <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Run on Server</property>
				</emphasis> wizard, with a best-guess full package. If, however, the selected
				element is an archive from the <link linkend="Project_archivesView">Project Archives
					view</link>, it will be published according to the rules of that module
			type.</para>
		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Bottom part of JBoss Server View</title>
			<para>In the bottom part of <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">JBoss Server View</property>
				</emphasis> there is a category called <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Modules</property>
				</emphasis> which should display all currently-published modules on the server.
				Right-clicking on the desired module and selecting <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Full Publish</property>
				</emphasis> will force a full rebuild of the entire module.</para>
			<figure float="0">
				<title>Full Publish</title>
				<mediaobject>
					<imageobject>
						<imagedata fileref="images/modules/modules_4.png"></imagedata>
					</imageobject>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>

			<para>Here, <emphasis>
					<property moreinfo="none">Incremental Publish</property>
				</emphasis> is meant to enable publishing of only those parts where changes have
				been made.</para>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Deploying with Project Archives View</title>
		<para>In the <property moreinfo="none">Project Archives View</property> you can right-click on any declared
			archive and select the <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">Publish To Server</property>
			</emphasis> element. For more on this subject, see <link linkend="PublishToServer">Publishing to Server</link> in the Project Archives View section.</para>
		<figure float="0">
			<title>Publish to Server</title>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="images/modules/modules_5.png"></imagedata>
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		</figure>
		<para> The only way to ensure an <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">Incremental Build</property>
			</emphasis>, such as changes to one <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">.jsp</property>, </emphasis>
			<emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">.html</property>, </emphasis> or <emphasis>
				<property moreinfo="none">.class</property>
			</emphasis> file, is to enable the builder for that project. This is done by either
			changing the global preferences for the <property moreinfo="none">Archives View</property>, or by
			enabling project-specific preferences and ensuring the builder is on.</para>
		<para>The last chapter covers a variety of methods on how you can deploy needed modules onto a
