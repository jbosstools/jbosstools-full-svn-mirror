  <title>Runtimes and Servers in the JBoss AS plugin</title>

  <para>In this chapter we will discuss how to install runtimes and servers.</para>

  <para>First of all it&apos;s necessary to mention that the JBoss AS plugin makes use of WTP.
    This includes starting and stopping servers in run or debug mode. It also includes targeting WTP
    projects, such as Dynamic Web Projects, to certain server runtimes in order to ensure that the
    proper jars from a specific server are added to the project&apos;s classpath
    properly.</para>
  <para>In order to get started creating, running, and debugging J2EE applications, we should create
    our <property>runtime</property> and <property>server</property> instances.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Runtimes</title>
    <para>In <property>JBoss Tools</property>, the main purpose of Server Runtimes is to point to a
      server installation somewhere on disk. In our case, this will be a JBoss installation, and it
      can then be used for two primary purposes:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>it provides classpath additions to WTP projects that require them.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>for <property>JBoss server</property> at least, it provides information necessary for
          the starting and stopping of the server, it tells which jars to run and which
          configuration to use.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <section id="InstNewRuntime">
      <title>Installing a New Runtime</title>
      <para>You can install runtimes into eclipse from the <emphasis>
          <property>Window &gt; Preferences </property>
        </emphasis> menu, and then select <emphasis>
          <property>Server &gt; Runtime Environments</property>
        </emphasis> from the categories available on the left.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Installed Runtimes</title>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>From this preference page you can see all declared runtimes and their types as well.
        Here, it&apos;s possible to edit or remove existing runtimes as well as add a new
        one.</para>

      <para>To create a JBoss runtime click <emphasis>
          <property>Add</property>
        </emphasis> button and choose a necessary type of runtime from the <emphasis>
          <property>JBoss Community</property>
        </emphasis> category.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Note:</title>

        <para>Now there is a separation between .org servers (the <emphasis>
            <property>JBoss Community</property>
          </emphasis> category) and product server that comes with JBoss EAP in JBDS ( the <emphasis>
            <property>JBoss Enterprise Middleware</property>
          </emphasis> category).</para>
      </note>

      <para>As you can see, <property>JBoss Tools</property> provide its own adapters such as JBoss
        3.2, 4.0, 4.2 and 5.0 as well. The last one comes with its own new feature, that is a safer
        incremental deployment, which prevents partial deployments to be picked up by the server. It
        means that scanning for auto-deployment is suspended while files are being copied to the
        deployment location and resumed when the copy is completed.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Note:</title>
        <para>Currently we recommend you to use a fully supported JBoss 4.2 server adapter.</para>
      </note>

      <para>You&apos;ll also note a Deploy-Only Runtime type. This type provides no classpath
        for WTP projects. It is used solely by its server type for the purpose of setting up a
        deploy directory for users who don&apos;t wish to make use of starting, stopping, or
        debugging their projects inside eclipse.</para>

                <para>The name of a new Runtime for a chosen server. We suggest that you
                  don&apos;t leave a default value. It&apos;s better to give descriptive

                <para>The proper Java Runtime Environment. Because of the open-source nature of
                  JBoss, a user is likely to want to modify and repackage some of the
                  configuration-specific jboss jars and create their own configuration. Thus, rather
                  than forcing you to copy his entire JBoss installation, the structure of the
                  wizard allows to create only a new configuration instead.</para>

                <para>The list of configurations (all, default, minimal) that is updated as soon as
                  you browse to a valid runtime installation folder. After the runtime is created
                  the configuration becomes an unchanging property of that runtime. To compile
                  against a different configuration's jars, you will need to create a new runtime
                  from that configuration.</para>

      </table>

      <para>As a result of having each runtime represent a specific configuration rather than the
        server installation as a whole, it is very likely you&apos;ll create several different
        runtimes to test each of your configurations. It becomes important to ensure your runtimes,
        and later your servers, are given descriptive names that help you remember which is
        which.</para>

      <para>Press <emphasis>

  <section>
    <title>Servers</title>
    <para>WTP servers are eclipse-representations of a backing server installation. They are used to
      start or stop servers, deploy to servers, or debug code that will run on the server. They keep
      track of the modules (jars, wars, etc) you deploy to the server and also allow you to undeploy
      those modules (see <link linkend="run_on_server_wizard">Deploying with Run On Server
        Wizard</link> section). </para>
    <para>Servers can be started or stopped with different <link linkend="com_line_arg">command-line
        arguments</link>. They are often backed by a runtime object representing that server's
      location.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Creating a New Server</title>

      <para>There are many ways to get to the new server wizard. One way is to use the old standard <emphasis>
          <property>File &gt; New &gt; Other... </property>
        </emphasis> and then <emphasis>
          <property>Server</property>
        </emphasis>. This should show the wizard like below.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Adding a JBoss Server</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="images/runtimes_servers/runtimes_servers_4.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>A server object is that keeps track of things like command line arguments when starting
        or stopping, and runtimes keep track of the location of the installation. Thus, each server
        instance must be backed by an appropriate runtime. </para>

      <para>From the list of already declared runtimes in the combo box below the view it&apos;s
        possible to select which runtime you want your server to be backed by. If there is no
        runtime that matches your needs just press the <emphasis>
          <property>Add...</property>
        </emphasis> link nearby to bring up the wizard for creating a new runtime (see the <link
          linkend="add_runtime_figure">previous section</link>). To configure the already installed
        runtimes you should go to server preferences that you can easily do by pressing the <emphasis>
          <property>Configure runtime environments...</property></emphasis> link.</para>

      <para>If the server you want to create doesn&apos;t have any installed runtime yet, the combo box
        and the links are absent.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Installed Server Runtime Environments</title>
        <mediaobject>

            <imagedata fileref="images/runtimes_servers/runtimes_servers_6.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>In this case the next page in the wizard which has the same form as in <link
          linkend="add_runtime_figure">the previous section</link> will ask you to create the
        associated runtime.</para>
      <para>Either way, after targeting your server to a runtime, the final screen in this wizard is
        largely confirmational, giving you a chance to verify that you&apos;ve selected the
        appropriate runtime. It also allows to name the server appropriately. </para>

      </figure>

      <para>Press <emphasis>
          <property>Finish</property>
        </emphasis> to complete the process of the server creation.</para>
      <para>Now that we&apos;ve created our runtimes and servers, we can dwell on all services
        and tools that JBoss Server Manager provides.</para>
