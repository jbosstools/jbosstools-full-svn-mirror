  <title>Runtimes and Servers in the JBoss AS plugin</title>

  <para>In this chapter we will discuss how to install runtimes and servers.</para>

  <para>First of all it is necessary to mention that the JBoss AS plugin makes use of WTP.
    This includes starting and stopping servers in run or debug mode. It also includes targeting WTP
    projects, such as Dynamic Web Projects, to certain server runtimes in order to ensure that the
    proper jars from a specific server are added to the project's classpath
    properly.</para>
  <para>In order to get started creating, running, and debugging J2EE applications, we should create
    our <property>runtime</property> and <property>server</property> instances.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Runtimes</title>
    <para>In <property>JBoss Tools</property>, the main purpose of Server Runtimes is to point to a
      server installation somewhere on disk. In our case, this will be a JBoss installation, and it
      can then be used for two primary purposes:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>it provides classpath additions to WTP projects that require them.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>for <property>JBoss server</property> at least, it provides information necessary for
          the starting and stopping of the server, it tells which jars to run and which
          configuration to use.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

   <section id="Detecting_a_new_runtime">
      <title>Detecting a new runtime</title>
      <para>
	 JBoss Tools features the ability to search, detect and add existing JBoss server runtimes installed on your system. If you don't have an existing runtime <xref linkend="InstNewRuntime"/> will guide you through the creation process. To begin searching for your existing JBoss runtime navigate to <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Window</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>JBoss Tools</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>JBoss Runtimes</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.

      <para>
	 The JBoss Runtimes preference page allows you to perform three different actions: <guibutton>Search</guibutton> for a JBoss runtime installation, <guibutton>Export</guibutton> a JBoss runtime configuration and <guibutton>Import</guibutton> the configuration of a JBoss runtime.
      </para>
      <para>
	 The <guibutton>Search</guibutton> button opens a file system browser window. Select a directory where you wish JBoss Tools to begin recursively searching for JBoss runtimes and upon completion it will return all those found. From the returned list, choose the runtimes you wish to make available to your JBoss Tools instance by clicking the box beside each runtime and clicking the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button.

        incremental deployment, which prevents partial deployments to be picked up by the server. It
        means that scanning for auto-deployment is suspended while files are being copied to the
        deployment location and resumed when the copy is completed.</para>

      <para>You&apos;ll also note a Deploy-Only Runtime type. This type provides no classpath
        for WTP projects. It is used solely by its server type for the purpose of setting up a
        deploy directory for users who don&apos;t wish to make use of starting, stopping, or
        debugging their projects inside eclipse.</para>

                  than forcing you to copy his entire JBoss installation, the structure of the

    <title>Servers</title>
    <para>WTP servers are eclipse-representations of a backing server installation. They are used to
      start or stop servers, deploy to servers, or debug code that will run on the server. They keep
      track of the modules (jars, wars, etc) you deploy to the server and also allow you to undeploy
      those modules (see <link linkend="run_on_server_wizard">Deploying with Run On Server
        Wizard</link> section). </para>
    <para>Servers can be started or stopped with different <link linkend="com_line_arg">command-line
        arguments</link>. They are often backed by a runtime object representing that server's
      location.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Creating a New Server</title>

      <para>There are many ways to get to the new server wizard. One way is to use the old standard <emphasis>
          <property>File &gt; New &gt; Other... </property>
        </emphasis> and then <emphasis>
          <property>Server</property>
        </emphasis>. This should show the wizard like below.</para>

      <para>A server object is that keeps track of things like command line arguments when starting
        or stopping, and runtimes keep track of the location of the installation. Thus, each server
        instance must be backed by an appropriate runtime. </para>

      <para> <emphasis><property> New server wizard </property></emphasis> allows to name the server appropriately in the <emphasis><property>Server name field </property></emphasis >or you can use a generated default name.If it's nessecary to restore the default name,after you defined yours, click the Reset default button(<inlinemediaobject>          <imageobject>

        From the list of already declared runtimes in the combo box below the view it&apos;s
        possible to select which runtime you want your server to be backed by. If there is no
        runtime that matches your needs just press the <emphasis>
          <property>Add...</property>
        </emphasis> link nearby to bring up the wizard for creating a new runtime (see the <link
          linkend="add_runtime_figure">Installing a New Runtime section</link>). To configure the already installed
        runtimes you should go to server preferences that you can easily do by pressing the <emphasis>
          <property>Configure runtime environments...</property></emphasis> link.</para>

      <para>If the server you want to create doesn&apos;t have any installed runtime yet, the combo box

      <para>In this case the next page in the wizard which has the same form as in <link
          linkend="add_runtime_figure">the previous section</link> will ask you to create the
        associated runtime.</para>
      <para>Either way, after targeting your server to a runtime, the final screen in this wizard is
        largely confirmational, giving you a chance to verify that you&apos;ve selected the
        appropriate runtime. </para>

      <para>Now that we&apos;ve created our runtimes and servers, we can dwell on all services
      and tools that JBoss Server Manager provides.</para>
