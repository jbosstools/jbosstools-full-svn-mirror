<!--
This is the XML DTD for the JAIN SLEE 1.0 deployable unit jar file deployment
descriptor.  All JAIN SLEE 1.0 deployable unit jar file deployment descriptors
must include a DOCTYPE of the following form:

  <!DOCTYPE deployable-unit PUBLIC
        "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD JAIN SLEE Deployable Unit 1.0//EN"
        "http://java.sun.com/dtd/slee-deployable-unit_1_0.dtd">
-->


<!-- 
The deployable-unit element is the root element of the deployable unit
deployment descriptor.  It contains an optional description about the
deployable unit jar file and the names of one or more component jars or
service deployment descriptors to be installed.
-->
<!ELEMENT deployable-unit (description?, (jar|service-xml)+)>

<!--
The description element may contain any descriptive text about the parent
element.

Used in: deployable-unit
-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
The jar element contains the name of a component jar file packaged within the
deployable unit jar file, to be installed with the deployable unit.  The name
must be relative URL, relative to the base of the deployable unit jar file.

Used in: deployable-unit

Example:
    <jar>components/sbbs.jar</jar>
-->
<!ELEMENT jar (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The service-xml element contains the name of a service deployment descriptor
file packaged within the deployable unit jar file, and containing the
definitions of one or more services to be installed with the deployable unit.
The name must be a relative URL, relative to the base of the deployable unit
jar file.

Used in: deployable-unit

Example:
    <service-xml>services/myservice.xml</service-xml>  
-->
<!ELEMENT service-xml (#PCDATA)>


<!-- 
The ID mechanism is to allow tools that produce additional deployment
information (ie. information beyond that contained by the standard SLEE
deployment descriptors) to store the non-standard information in a separate
file, and easily refer from those tools-specific files to the information in
the standard deployment descriptor.  The SLEE architecture does not allow the
tools to add the non-standard information into the SLEE-defined deployment
descriptors.
