The existing hibernate documentation is wrapped into eclipse help by this
plugin.  No additional content is provided.  The quick reference pdf 
is not included.


To build, run default target of build.xml.

The build depends on the document source in the hibernate source to build the
table of contents files (toc*).  Therfore, a successful build depends on the
Hibernate3 source tree residing at ../../Hibernate3.

The build depends on the distribution html files for the help content.
Therefore, a successful build depends on the hibernate distribution residing
at ../../hibernate-3.0.

The build also depends on the saxon xslt translator used by the Hibernate3
documentation generator.  The build uses the very same saxon jar file as in
Hibernate3 to perform the build.  The xslt files generate table of contents.

The toc-refdoc.xsl file translates the reference document xml files into a
table of contents for the 'reference document'.  The toc-apiref.xsl file
translates the Hibernate3 build.xml (javadoc targets) into the api reference
table of contents.

The 'id' attribute in the reference documentation source is used to build the
href in the table of contents.  Not all 'sect[123]' elements have this
attribute.  Whether this is intended or not, I don't know.  Until it is fixed,
it is not possible to reference these sections.  This build will generate the
following message (exampe) when it encounters this situation.
 'id' attribute is not present on 'sect' element titled: 'Batch inserts'
   in module: batch.xml
