<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>This nightly build is a direct build from CVS and is provided as-is with no guarantees. Be advised that while there is no
prior proof, if this build sets fire to your computer, you were sufficiently warned!</p>

<p>Any suggestions/issues should be posted on the relevant product
forums and should clearly indicate that you are using an nightly build. Please take care in making sure that your issue hasn't
already been addressed when posting on forums or opening new JIRA issues.</p>

<h2>Versioning/Updates</h2>
<p>
	JBossIDE Nightly builds follow this simple versioning convention:
	Nyyyymmddhhss.
	
	Everything after the "N" is a timestamp formatting field.
	
	It should be noted that any if you install an nightly build into your workspace, Eclipse will not recognize any official release
	as being an update due it's version number ordering rules. If you want to upgrade to a stable release from an
	nightly build, you will need to remove all of the plugin and feature directories that are bundled with JBossIDE, and then proceed
	with normal installation. If you are still having trouble with stable / release plugins after un-installing a nightly build, try passing
	the "-clean" argument to Eclipse at startup.
