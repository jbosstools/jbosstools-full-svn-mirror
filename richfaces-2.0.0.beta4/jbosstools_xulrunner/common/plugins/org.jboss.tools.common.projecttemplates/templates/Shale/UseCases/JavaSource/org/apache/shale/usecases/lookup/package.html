<body>

<p>This package contains <code>ViewController</code> beans for the remoting
support that is implemented via JSP pages, instead of Java code.  This allows
the developer to leverage the controller, expression evaluation, and managed
beans capabilities of JSF, and the templating capabilities of JSP+JSTL, with
easy code sharing between remoting support and human user interaction support
within the same web application.</p>
