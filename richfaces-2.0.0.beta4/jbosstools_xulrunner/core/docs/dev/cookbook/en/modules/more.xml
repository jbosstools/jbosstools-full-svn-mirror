Lazy Initialization:
   Eclipse has a large passion for what is called Lazy Initialization. A plug-in is 

officially loaded, and its OSGi bundle put into memory, whenever any class from the 

plug-in is requested. Often times it is not necessary to initialize the entire plug-in 

at this point. If your plug-in needs to load a large model to be FULLY functional, for 

example, and another plugin wishes to use only one of your classes, you don't want 

your entire plugin and model to be initialized unnecessarily.
   Another example of eclipse's lazy initialization is more evident through it's 

plugin.xml file and manifest.mf file. As we'll see later on, these files list 

information about your plugin to keep as much information available without loading 

the implementations until completely necessary. A great example of this is having your 

plugin add actions to a context menu when right-clicking on a method or field, all 

through the .xml file. Rather than load your plugin, or even the action, the 

plugin.xml file simply lists what classes will be used when the action is invoked. 

This way, your actions are added to the menu without your plugin being loaded until 

the action is called. 
   Because of this structure, a lot of key information will be in your plugin.xml 

file, which can be edited manually or through a graphical editor.
