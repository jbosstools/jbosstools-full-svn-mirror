To install the designer from the downloaded zip file, you have to work your way through a number of very easy steps. The described installation process has been tested with the 3.1M4 version of Eclipse. Start Eclipse and use the regular plugin installation mechanism : select 'Help->Software Updates->Find and Install...'

On the first page of the 'Install/Update' wizard, select 'Search for new features to install.' and press the 'Next' button. On the next page, press the 'New Archived Site...' button. Navigate to your freshly downloaded zip file, select it and press the 'Open' button. Check the checkbox next to the newly created entry in the 'Sites to include in search' list and press the 'Next' button. One feature should appear, make sure you select the checbox next to it and click 'Next' again. Accept the license agreement and push the 'Next' and then the 'Finish' button. Eclipse will now ask you whether or not to install the selected features. Push the 'Install All' button and conclude the installation by restarting Eclipse. 

If you start designing make sure you have the default Outline view and the default Properties view visible somewhere in your Eclipse workbench. Otherwise you will not be able to make use of the support for Java actions. This implies also that you are working in a Java project.
