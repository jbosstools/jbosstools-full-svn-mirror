		Each element in the navigator displays the resolved HTTP method (for example: GET and POST) followed by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) path template (for example: /customers/{id}). <property>@Path</property> annotations are available for resources and subresources, at the method level. Optional <property>@ApplicationPath</property> annotation is available only any subclass of <classname>javax.ws.rs.core.Application</classname>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Under each element are the resolved, consumed and produced media types (based on the annotations you have supplied for the method or type) and the associated Java method.
	</para>
