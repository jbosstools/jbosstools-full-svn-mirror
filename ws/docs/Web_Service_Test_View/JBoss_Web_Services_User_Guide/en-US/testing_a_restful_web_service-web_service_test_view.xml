  <title>Testing a RESTful Web Service</title>
  <para>
    Testing a RESTful (<acronym>JAX-RS</acronym>) web service is achieved by following a similar procedure to testing a JAX-WS web service. Instead of selecting the JAX-WS option in the combo box, the JAX-RS service is invoked by sending HTTP method requests of the form OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. As there is no WSDL file associated with a JAX-RS service, the available options can be determined by selecting <guilabel>OPTIONS</guilabel> in the combo box.
