	<section><title>How can the IDE help me?</title>
		
		<para>The AOP IDE attempts to make creating, building, and testing 
		aop applications much easier. It provides most of its assistance 
		visually, through both of its views (Aspect Manager View, and Advised Members View),
		as well as markers in editors. An assortment of dialogs and actions attempt to make
		creating type expressions or method expressions easier as well. </para>
		
		<para>The plug-in also provides an incremental builder so that testing
		your application can proceed as painlessly as possible. </para>
