         If your eclipse has RSE tools installed, you will now be able to 
         direct your server to publish to an RSE location. In the future, 
         this will extend to starting and stopping your server as well. 
         For now, starting and stopping automatically "succeed" with no
         actual action being taken when in RSE mode.

      <p>The JBoss Servers View has finally been removed. Users should 
         notice no functionality hit by using the official Server's view. 
         The JBossTools Module Assembly page, which had been "bleeding edge" 
         and not quite polished, has also been removed and its functionality
         can be found in the WTP Module Assembly Properties Page instead.</p>
      <p>A side-effect of this is that you can now add filesets to projects
         other than JBossTools projects, such as EAR, WEB, and EJB projects </p>
