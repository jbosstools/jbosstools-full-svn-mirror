  <title>JBoss SOAP Web Services Runtime and Tools support Overview</title>
  <para>JBoss SOAP Web Services is a web service framework developed as a part of the JBoss Application Server. It implements the JAX-WS specification. JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services) defines a programming model and run-time architecture for implementing web services in Java, targeted at the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 (Java EE 5). </para>
  <para>JBossWS integrates with most current JBoss Application Server releases as well as earlier ones, that did implement the J2EE 1.4 specifications. Even though JAX-RPC, the web service specification for J2EE 1.4, is still supported JBossWS does put a clear focus on JAX-WS.</para>
  <para>JBossWS Tools work with the <property>JBossWS Runtime</property>. Users can easily create, deploy and run a Web Service(WSDL based) and a Web Service Client using JBossWS Tool and JBossWS Runtime.</para>
  <para>Also JBossWS Tool gives a way to test a web service running on a server.</para>
