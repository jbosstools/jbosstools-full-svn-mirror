    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>JSF Tools are especially designed for supporting JSF and JSF-related technologies. JSF
        Tools provide extensible and exemplary tools for building JSF-based applications as well as
        adding JSF capabilities to existing web projects, importing JSF projects and choosing any
        JSF implementation while developing JSF application.</para>

    <para>In this guide we provide you with the information on JSF tooling which allows you to
        develop JSF applications much faster and with far fewer errors so sparing your time.</para>
