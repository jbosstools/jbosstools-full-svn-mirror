<b>WARNING</b>
<p>This integration build is a test of stability before a major release. In general, integration builds will be more stable
than nightly builds, but there is still no guarantees (especially against fire!).</p>

<p>Any suggestions/issues should be posted on the relevant product
forums and should clearly indicate that you are using an integration build. Please take care in making sure that your issue hasn't
already been addressed when posting on forums or opening new JIRA issues.</p>

<b>Versioning</b>
<p>
	JBossIDE Integration builds follow this simple versioning convention:
	Iyyyymmddhhss.
	
	Everything after the "I" is a timestamp formatting field.
	
	It should be noted that any if you install an integration build into your workspace, Eclipse will not recognize any official release
	as being an update due to it's version number ordering rules. If you want to upgrade to a stable release from an
	integration build, you will need to remove all of the plugin and feature directories that are bundled with JBossIDE, and then proceed
	with normal installation. If you are still having trouble with stable / release plugins after un-installing an integration build, try passing
	the "-clean" argument to Eclipse at startup.
