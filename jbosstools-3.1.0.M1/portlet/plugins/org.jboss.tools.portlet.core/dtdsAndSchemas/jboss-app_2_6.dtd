<!--
When a web application is deployed, the context path under wich it is deployed
is taken as application name. The application name value in this descriptor is
used to override it. When a component references a references a portlet, it needs to
reference the application too and if the portlet application war file is renammed
the reference is not valid anymore. Therefore this tag is used to have an application
name that does not depend upon the context path under which the application is deployed.
