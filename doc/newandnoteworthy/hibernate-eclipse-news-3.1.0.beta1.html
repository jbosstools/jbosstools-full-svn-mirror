      <p>Going from Alpha to Beta means that the Ant "API" has been
      settled. This require some changes for users which used ant with
      the alpha versions. The changes are listed in our JIRA at <a

    <td valign="top">
      <p>Previous releases could not use EJB3 annotation based mapping
      when performing queries etc. That is now possible to enable on
      the console configuration. Note: using this feature require you
      to run Eclipse under a Java 5 runtime) </p>
        <p> Furthermore we have added support for providing a custom
        entity-resolver which can be usefull when using XML entities
        as done in some parts of our <a
        href="http://caveatemptor.hibernate.org/">CaveatEmptor</a>
        project. </p>

          <p>Annotation support also include improved EJB3 POJO
          generation and generating &lt;mapping&gt; with a
          <code>class</code> attribute instead of
          <code>resource</code> when generating
          <code>hibernate.cfg.xml</code> </p>

    <td valign="top">
      <p>This release finally make the <code>reveng.xml</code> editor available.</p>
        <p>The editor is intended to allow easy definition of type mappings, table include/excludes and specific override settings for columns, e.g. define a explicit name for a column when the default naming rules is not applicable.</p>

          <p>Note that not all the features of the <code>.reveng.xml</code> file is exposed or fully implemented in the editor, but the main functionallity is there for you to use and comment on. </p>

      <p>The overview page where the wanted console configuration is selected (auto-detected if Hibernate 3 support is enabled for the project)</p>
      <p><img src="revengxml_tablefilters.png"></p>
      <p>The table filter page allows you to specify which tables to include and exclude. Note: in the alpha version you had to add an exclude for all tables at the bottom to avoid reverse engineering the whole database, in the beta version this behavior has been changed. Now the "everything is included" rule is only active if no filters has been defined - if a include or exclude filter has been defined nothing is included by default. </p>
      <p><img src="revengxml_typemappings.png"></p>
        <p>Type mappings page is used for specifying type mappings from jdbc types to any hibernate type (including usertypes) if the default rules are not applicable.</p>
      <p><img src="revengxml_tablescolumn.png"></p>
        <p>Table & Columns page allow the user to explicit set e.g. which hibernatetype and propertyname that should be used in the reverse engineered model.</p>
