<h1>Hibernate Tools</h1>
<b><big>Reverse engineering and code generation with Eclipse plugins and a hbm.xml editor</big></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Version:</b> 3.1 beta 1, 14. October 2005

<hr>

<div id="toc"></div>

<p><i>Please note that this release is a preview release and considered alpha
quality. The presented functionality (reverse engineering, code generation, etc.)
is also be available outside of Eclipse, ie. as Ant tasks. 

See the <a href="http://tools.hibernate.org">Hibernate Tools website</a> for more
information about the road map.</i></p>


<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>We have made significant improvements to the Hibernate toolset for Hibernate3. This is however work in progress and we'll continue to implement new ideas and features as the third generation of the Hibernate3 object persistence stack evolves.
</p>

<p>The first set of tools we offer are plugins for the Eclipse IDE. The following features are available:</p>

<p><b>Mapping Editor:</b> An editor for Hibernate XML mapping files, supporting auto-completion and syntax highlighting. It also supports semantic auto-completion for class names and property/field names, making it much more versatile than a normal XML editor.</p>

<p><b>Console:</b> The console is a new view in Eclipse. In addition to a tree overview of your console configurations, you also get an interactive view of your persistent classes and their relationships. The console allows you to execute HQL queries against your database and browse the result directly in Eclipse.</p>

<p><b>Development Wizards:</b> Several wizards are provided with the Hibernate Eclipse tools; you can use a wizard to quickly generate Hibernate configuration (cfg.xml) files, or you may even completely reverse engineer an existing database schema into POJO source files and Hibernate mapping files. The reverse engineering wizard supports customizable templates.</p>

<h2>2. Requirements</h2>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Install Eclipse 3.1 (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org</a>)</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>After you have downloaded the Hibernate Tools for Eclipse, unpack and copy the plugins to your Eclipse plugins directory. 
Sometimes Eclipse does not automatically detect new plugins and thus the tools will not be activated. To ensure eclipse sees
these changes run eclipse with the -clean option. E.g. <code>eclipse -clean</code>
</p>

<p>You will also need JDBC drivers for your database available to use the reverse engineering and querying support.</p>

<p>
  Please note that these tools do not try to hide any functionality of Hibernate. The tools make working with
  Hibernate easier, but you are still encouraged/required to read the documentation for Hibernate to fully
  utilize Hibernate.
</p>

<h2>3. Creating a Hibernate configuration file</h2>

  <p>
    To be able to reverse engineer, prototype queries, and of course to
    simply use Hibernate a hibernate.properties or hibernate.cfg.xml
    file is needed. The Hibernate Tools provide a wizard for generating
    the hibernate.cfg.xml file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Start the wizard by clicking "New Wizard" (Ctrl+N), select the Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration file (cfg.xml)
    wizard and press "Next". After selecting the location for the hibernate.cfg.xml file, you will see the following page: 
  </p>
  <img src="hibernatecfgwizard.jpg" border="1"/>
  <br><b>Creating hibernate.cfg.xml</b></br><br>

    <p>
      Enter your configuration information in this dialog. Details about the configuration options can be found
      in Hibernate reference documentation. Press "Finish" to create the configuration file, it will be
      automatically opened in an editor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tip: The contents in the combo boxes for the JDBC driver class and JDBC URL change automatically, depending
      on the Dialect and actual driver you have chosen.
    </p>

<h2>4. XML Mapping Editor</h2>

<p>The XML mapping editor provides basic XML editing functionality as well as package, class, and field
completion for relevant XML attributes. The auto-completion detects it's context and limits the completion for e.g.
&lt;property&gt; and only shows the properties/fields available in the
  enclosing &lt;class&gt;, &lt;subclass&gt; etc.</p>

  <img src="hbmxmlcompletion.jpg" border="1"/>
  <br><b>Context dependent code completion in the XML mapping editor</b></br><br>
    
<h2>5. Hibernate Console perspective</h2>

<p>The Hibernate Console perspective combines a set of views which allow
  you to see the structure of your mapped entities/classes, edit HQL queries, execute
  the queries, and see the results. To use this perspective you need to create a console configuration.
</p>

<h3>5.1 Creating a console configuration</h3>

  <p>
    You create a console configuration by running the Console Configuration wizard, shown in the following screenshot:
  </p>
    
  <img src="consolecfgwizard.jpg" border="1"/>
  <br><b>Creating a Hibernate Console configuration</b></br><br>

    <p>
      The following table describes the available settings. The wizard can automatically detect default values.
    </p>

      <table width="100%" border="1">
        <th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Autodetect</th>
          <tr>
            <td>Name</td><td>The unique name of the configuration</td><td>Name of the Java project</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Property file</td><td>Path to a hibernate.properties file/td><td>First hibernate.properties file found in the project</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td nowrap="true">Configuration file</td><td>Path to a hibernate.cfg.xml</td><td>First hibernate.cfg.xml found in the project</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Mapping files</td><td>List of additional mapping files that should be loaded. Note: A hibernate.cfg.xml can also contain mappings, avoid duplication.</td><td>All hbm.xml files found in the project</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>Classpath</td><td>The classpath for loading POJO and JDBC drivers. Don't add Hibernate core libraries or
dependencies, they are already included.</td><td>The default build output directory and any JARs with a class implementing java.sql.Driver</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking "Finish" creates the configuration and shows it in the Console overview.
    </p>

<h3>5.2 Viewing the entity structure</h3>

<p>
  To view your new configuration and entity/class structure, right click the
configuration in the list and select "Create SessionFactory". This will create a
standard Hibernate <tt>SessionFactory</tt> using your settings.</p>

<p>Clicking on the small <tt>+</tt> symbol allows you to browse the class/entity structure
and see the relationships.</p>

<p>Errors during creation of the <tt>SessionFactory</tt> (e.g. if your configuration is incorrect) will
be shown in a message dialog, you may get more information about the error in the Error Log view on the
right pane.
</p>

<h3>5.3 Prototyping Queries</h3>

<p>Queries can be executed in two ways: by double clicking on entity
  names in the tree or by entering HQL in the HQL editor and pressing
    the green execute button.</p>

    <p>Results of a query will be shown in the Query result view and
    details of possible errors (syntax errors, database errors, etc.) can
    be seen in the Error Log view.</p>

<p>Tip: HQL queries are executed using <tt>list()</tt> and
without any limit of the size of the output. Be careful if you
execute a query on a large result set. You might run out of memory. This
will be improved in a future version.</p>

<h3>5.4 Properties view</h3>

<p>The properties view shows the structure of any selected persistent object in the results view. Editing is not yet supported.</p>

<p>The properties view is still very experimental, thus if you experience issues while having it visible then close it to be able
to work with the remaining functionallity</p>


<h2>6. Reverse engineering and code generation</h2>

<p>A very simple "click-and-generate" reverse engineering and code generation facility is
also available. The reverse engineering internally creates a Hibernate meta model. On this meta-model
a set of (velocity) templates are applied, generating a set of artifacts. Currently supported are
POJO Java source file, Hibernate *.hbm.xml, and hibernate.cfg.xml generation. To start this process,
choose the "Hibernate Artifact Generation Wizard".</p>

  <img src="codegenwizard.jpg" border="1"/>
  <br><b>Artifact Generation Wizard</b></br><br>

    <p>
      First select which Console configuration should be used and the target directory for
code and mapping file generation. Note: Generation will generate files, and overwrite
      possibly existing files in this location. 
    </p>

   <p>Now choose from the following list of options:</p>

    <p>
      <h3>6.1 Reverse engineering</h3>

        <p>
          Reverse engineering will connect to your database and read the JDBC metadata of your
	database schema.  The basic rules for the conversion is that each table/view
          found is mapped to a POJO class, and each column is mapped to a
          property. The package name controls the "root" package of the
          generated classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          For each found foreign key, a &lt;many-to-one&gt; and a corresponding
          &lt;one-to-many&gt; mapping, using a <tt>Set</tt>, will be created. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The flag "Generate 'raw' composite ids" turns on special handling of
	composite primary keys. A &lt;composite-id&gt; mapping will always be
	created, and if there are matching
          foreign-keys, a &lt;key-many-to-one&gt; will be created as well.
          If you choose to active the 'raw' composite ids, then
          each composite key column is considered a 'raw' scalar
          (string, long, etc.) instead of a reference to an
          entity. Note: a &lt;many-to-one&gt; property is still
          created, but is simply marked as non-updatable and
          non-insertable.
        </p>

      <h3>6.2 POJO code generation</h3>
        
        <p>
          The code generation will generate all the persistent classes
          and components found in the given Hibernate configuration.</p>
	  You can
          use the code generation on your own handwritten or reverse-engineered
	mapping files.
        </p>

          <p>
            This "EJB3/JSR-220 annotations" option will activate usage of the
            EJB3 sections in the javaclass.vm template. This is considered
	experimental and currently incomplete. Updates to the template are
expected, you can even write (and hopefully
            contribute) more powerful templates.
          </p>

        <p>
          The Java code generation is based on a a complete
          rewrite of the hbm2java found in the Hibernate 2.x toolset.  This
          means that feature-wise they should be equal, but
          there might be some exotic &lt;meta&gt; features
          not fully implemented so far. Please report any bugs or missing
	code generation features via our issue tracking system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Consult the Hibernate documentation for the various code generation
	tags you can use in your mapping files.
        </p>

      <h3>6.3 Hibernate Mapping file generation</h3>   

        <p>
          This creates a hbm.xml for each class declared in the
          configuration (and their persistent subclasses). Each
          &lt;subclass&gt; or &lt;joined-subclass&gt; will be written 
          to a separate mapping file, an <tt>extends</tt> attribute is used.
        </p>

        <p>
          The mapping file generation feature currently supports only basic
	generation, completing the reverse engineering functionality. More
	features will be added in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>6.4 Hibernate configuration file generation</h3>

          <p>
            This option writes a hibernate.cfg.xml with all relevant
            properties and with a &lt;mapping&gt; reference
            for each persistent class          </p>

      <h3>6.5 Custom templates</h3>

        <p>
          All of the generated code is controlled via templates (except
          the hibernate.cfg.xml). The wizard searches
          for the templates in the classpath of the plugin, by default.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can customize templates by placing
          your own .vm files in a directory and naming the directory
	in the wizard dialog.
          You can override existing templates by using the same file names.
The built-in templates can be found in the hibernate-tools.jar in
          the org.hibernate.eclipse plugin directory.
        </p>

        <p>
         You may use a pre-defined set of variables and properties in templates,
	as shown in the following table.
          </p>

          <table border=1 width='100%'>
            <th>Name</th><th>Contents</th><th>Availability</th>
              <tr>
                <td>$cfg</td><td>The current Hibernate Configuration object. See Hibernate3 javadocs for available properties/methods.</td><td>Anywhere</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>$c2h</td><td>A Cfg2HbmTool. Contains a set of helper methods related to cfg to hbm conversion. See sourcecode and existing templates for available properties/methods.</td><td>Anywhere</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>$c2j</td><td>A Cfg2JavaTool. Contains a set of helper methods related to cfg to java conversion. See sourcecode and existing templates for available properties/methods.</td><td>Anywhere</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>$clazz</td><td>A reference to the current PersistentClass or Component being processed.</td><td>In any class related template</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>$property</td><td>A reference to the current Property being processed</td><td>In any property related template</td>
              </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
            Note that some of these properties are only available in
            a certain context (e.g. $property is not available at the
            Class level, but only fo rproperties).
            If you need to look up some information, you have full
            access to Hibernate's own meta-model, the <tt>Configuration</tt> via $cfg.
            This combined with the power of velocity templates should
            give you virtually unlimited flexibility and possibilities
            for code generation.
          </p>
	
	<p>
          Note that we expect significant changes to the structure and
	organization of the built-in templates in one of the next releases.
	</p>
	<h2>7. Enable debug logging</h2>
	
	<p>It is possible to configure the eclipse plugin to route all logging made
	by the plugins and hibernate code it self to the "Error log" view in Eclipse.</p>
	
	<p>
	This is done by editing the "hibernate-log4j.properties" in org.hibernate.eclipse/ directory/jar.
	This file includes a default configuration that only logs WARN and above to a set of custom
	appenders (PluginFileAppender and PluginLogAppender). You can change these settings to be as verbose
	or silent as you please - see hibernate documentation for interesting categories and log4j documentation
	for how to configure logging via a log4j property file.
	</p>
