    <para>As stated at the beginning of this document, the key goal of the <property>EGT</property>
        is to provide a way of interacting with Guvnor repository resources in a local Eclipse
        workspace. While clearly there is a lot more that could be done, and no doubt there will be
        aspects of the current tooling that require revision going forward, we feel that the current
        state of the <property>EGT</property> is sufficient for the major use cases.</para>
