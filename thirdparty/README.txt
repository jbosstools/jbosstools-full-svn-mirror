THIS FOLDER IS OBSOLETE AND SAFE TO DELETE.

Its purpose was to create a subset of Orbit for use w/ JBoss Tools, but that's no longer needed since we have the Target Platform repo, which can use plugins w/o wrapping them in features, and the plugins are available on the download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/requirements/orbit/ mirror.
