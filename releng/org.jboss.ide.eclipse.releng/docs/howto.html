		<h2>JBossIDE Releng Build System HOWTO</h2><br/>
		
		Welcome to the JBossIDE Build System. To succesfully build JBossIDE, you will need to first go through a few setup steps to prepare the build environment.<br/><br/>
		<b>Build Preparation</b>:<br/>
		<ol>
		<li>Download JWSDP 1.6. Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to distribute jwsdp binaries with our build system version control.
			The quickest way to obtain JWSDP 1.6 is by going to this URL and downloading the correct package for your system:<br/>
			
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html</a><br/><br/>
			
			After downloading, you will need to either copy or move your file (jwsdp-1_6-unix.sh OR jwsdp-1_6-windows-i586.exe) to this directory:
			<pre>org.jboss.ide.eclipse.releng/requirements/jwsdp</pre>
			
			Note that if you are using unix/linux you will need to chmod the shell script to 755 like so:
			<pre>chmod 755 jwsdp-1_6-unix.sh</pre>
			
			After copying the file, you should double-check the properties file here:
			<pre>org.jboss.ide.eclipse.releng/requirements/jwsdp/build.properties</pre>
			
			Make sure your filename matches up with either the <b>jwsdp.win32.installer</b> or <b>jwsdp.unix.installer</b> properties in that file.<br/><br/>
		</li>
		<li>Run the customizeBuild.xml ant script. There are two targets in this script, depending on how you plan on running the JBossIDE Build system.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="customizeBuild.html#gui-customize">Swing based GUI Customization (most users)</a></li>
				<li><a href="customizeBuild.html#properties-customize">Properties-file Customization (sysadmins, cruisecontrol)</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h2>Quick Start</h2>
		The quickest way to get started is to try an integration build of the entire JBossIDE product. Be warned though, this can take upwards of 20-30 minutes on slower machines, and even longer if publishing is enabled.<br/>
		To run an integration build, from the builders directory, execute:<br/>
		<br/>
		On Windows:
		<pre>build-integration.bat product</pre>
		On Unix:
		<pre>./build-integration.sh product</pre>
		
		After the build is complete, you should see various zip files in various folders in your build output directory.<br/><br/>
		
		<h2>Builders and Build Types</h2>
		The JBossIDE Build system breaks down builds into 3 seperate types. Integration, Nightly, and Release builds.
		Integration and Nightly builds are technically only different in the fact that they use Ixxxx and Nxxxx release tags, but the seperation is there for semantics.
		Both builds will append the Ixxxx or Nxxxx string to the end of the current release version of each plugin and feature being built.<br/><br/>
		
		<h3>Release builds</h3><br/>
		Release builds are special in that they have a "tags" file which maps each builder to a specific sub-version. The name of the tags file is ${release-name}.tags,
		and it lives under builders/product/versionTags. Here is an example from the JBossIDE 1.5M2 release (1.5M2.tags):
<pre>
aop=1.1.0.beta3
ejb3=1.0.0.beta3
core=1.5.0.M2
hibernate-tools=alpha4a
</pre>
		
		When building a release build, the build-release script requires an extra argument; the release name. i.e:
		<pre>./build-release.sh product 1.5M2</pre>
		
		<h3>Builders</h3>
		The build system also supports building standalone builders seperately from the entire product.
		It should be noted that building seperately does not currently support scp publishing, or email notification.
		For example, to do an integration build of Hibernate Tools:
		<pre>./build-integration.sh hibernate-tools</pre>
		
		You can find a list of builders by looking at the directories under the builders directory (everything except common).
