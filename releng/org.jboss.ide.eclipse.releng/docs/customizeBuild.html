			<ul>
				<li>
					You will need to run the customizeBuild.xml with a recent version of Ant (tested w/ 1.6.5) like so:<br/>
					<pre>ant -f customizeBuild.xml</pre><br/><br/>
					
					The dialog you receive should look something like this:<br/>
					<img src="gui.jpg"/><br/>
					
					Here's a breakdown of the fields and what they mean:
					<table border="1">
						<tr>
							<td><b>Location of eclipse zip binaries</b></td>
							<td>This should be a directory where the various binary zip distributions of eclipse live. By default, the build system expects
									both win32 and linux-gtk builds to be in this directory. You can configure which eclipse builds are used as
									build targets / bundle targets in builders/product/build.properties, in the eclipse.builds property (available after customization).
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Location for build binaries</b></td>
							<td>
								The entire build output hierarchy will be placed in this directory (ZIPs, build logs, etc). It is recommended that this be a directory other than where you checked out the releng project.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Location of a clean eclipse 3.1 installation (no external plugins)</b></td>
							<td>
								The top level directory where a fresh extract of eclipse 3.1 lives. Note that this eclipse extract should be completely clean of external plugins.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Location of JBossIDE Releng Project Root</b></td>
							<td>
								This is the top level directory of the jbosside releng project. If you ran the customizeBuild.xml ant script correctly, this should be automatically set correctly for you.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Location of SSH Private Key</b></td>
							<td>
								The location of a ssh private key for publishing build results. Unless you are a JBossIDE developer, you should ignore this.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>SSH Passphrase</b></td>
							<td>
								SSH passphrase for the selected private key. Unless you are a JBossIDE developer, you should ignore this.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Enable SCP Publishing?</b></td>
							<td>
								Enable/Disable scp publishing of build zips and logs. Unless you are a JBossIDE developer, you should ignore this.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Enable Emal Notification?</b></td>
							<td>
								Enable/Disable email notification. Unless you are a JBossIDE developer, you should ignore this.
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<br/>
					
					After filling out all the fields, you can click "Next>" and the customization process will finish.

				Start by copying customize.properties.example to customize.properties. After it's copied, let's open it up and take a look at each property and what it means.
					<table border="1">

							<td>This should be a directory where the various binary zip distributions of eclipse live. By default, the build system expects
