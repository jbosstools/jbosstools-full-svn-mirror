Template for reference guide.

How to build everything:
 mvn install

Just build just html-single:
 mvn -Phtml-single install

 Other profiles: pdf, html, eclipse

 Look for other <profile>'s in parent pom.
   
Guidelines: 
 use lowercase names for filenames to avoid casing issues
 on various OS's and to make it easier to search for names/content.

 Comment out chapters/sections that is not correct/actively maintained.

Known issues: 
 Translation dependds on ${docname} and other variables
 in artifactid but that is not really supported/recommended by Maven
