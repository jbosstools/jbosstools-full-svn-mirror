        <title>What is Guvnor Tools?</title>
        <para>The <property>Guvnor repository</property> is not intended as a Source Code Management
        (SCM) solution, and the <property>EGT</property> is not intended to be Eclipse “team
        provider” extension or replacement. Rather, the Guvnor repository is a location where
        certain artifacts (such as rules and SOA policy definitions) are controlled (“governed”) by
        policies defined by the deployment environment. The purpose of the <property>EGT</property>
        is then to enable access to resources held by the Guvnor repository, so
        they can be used in development. Thus, limited capabilities for reading, writing, adding,
        and removing Guvnor repository resources are provided in the
            <property>EGT</property>.</para>

        <title>Requirements and Installation</title>

        <para><property>Guvnor Tools</property> is a part of the <property>JBoss Tools</property>
            project. Thus to get started with Guvnor Tools, you should have the following:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Eclipse 3.4.x with Jboss Tools bundle of Eclipse plugins installed. How to
                    install JBoss Tools onto Eclipse you can find in the JBoss Tools Installation section.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
                <para>JBoss Server 4.2 or higher with Guvnor repository deployed.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>To have JBoss Server with Guvnor repository deployed, you should
            download <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/drools/downloads.html">Drools Guvnor</ulink>.
            When downloading you may choose either web based Guvnor to deploy to your
            JBoss Server or Standalone Guvnor with JBoss AS.</para> 
        <para>If you use a JBoss AS 5 and a <property>Guvnor Tools</property> doesn't work when deployed to the server,
        you should do the following to get Guvnor Tools running:</para>
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Remove the  JBoss Security libraries (authorization-spi-2.0.2.CR6.jar, 
                    identity-*, acl-spi-2.0.2.CR6.jar) from drools WAR file (not the app server itself).                    
                    The JBoss Security libraries are provided in AS 5.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Remove the JAXP libraries (xercesImpl-2.8.0.jar, xml-apis-2.*)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Remove the EL libraries (el-*)</para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>After this, Guvnor should operate as normal.            
            During deployment, you would see the following exception in the log which indicates that the experiemental
            JBoss Security based ACL integration has defined some EJB3/JPA stuff in guvnor that has not been configured.</para>
        <programlisting>ERROR [AbstractKernelController] Error installing to Start: name=persistence.unit:unitName=#ACL state=Create
java.lang.RuntimeException: Specification violation [EJB3 JPA 6.2.1.2] - You have not defined a non-jta-data-source 
for a RESOURCE_LOCAL enabled persistence context named: ACL            
        </programlisting>
        <para>Now refer to the <xref linkend="functionality_overview"/> 
            section to find out what you can do with Guvnor and
            Eclipse synchronisation tool.</para>
