  what tests have to be done(JBDS50_0010):
   * Validations works good for Inconsistent specialization, 
     Ambiguous EL names, Unproxyable bean types, Decorator resolution
   * Quick fixes for problem markers in beans.xml(https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-9833)
   * CDI @Named beans are renamed via refactoring and shows up correctly 
      when using Find References for EL Expressions
   * Create new decorator from existing Web Bean
   * EL refactoring for @Named beans works
   
   
   what tests have to be done(JBDS50_0015):
   * OpenOn works for injected classes
   * OpenOn works in Seam Config for given beans
   * OpenOn works for Bean injected into java source files declard in seam-config.xml can be navigated
   * Seam-beans.xml validation works
   * Seam3 not-trivial example works with JBDS without errors and as expected
   * Wel extension(beans_1_1.xsd) is now supported by beans.xml editor
   * Non-serializable passivating-scoped beans are now validated correctly
   * Code completion and validation works in seam config for annotated CDI beans
   * Seam3 features is enabled automatically for CDI support enabled project containing corresponding Seam module
   * CDI supports Seam3 annotations (@Veto,@Requires,@Exact,@MessageLogger,@MessageBundle 
      @DefaultBean,@Unwraps,@ServiceHandlerType,@FullyQualified,@Resource)
   * CDI tools can work with generic beans and validation, code completion, hyperlinks, 
     refactoring is working as expected
