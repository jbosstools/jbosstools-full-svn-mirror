/**
 * what tests have to be done(JBDS50_0010):
 *  1. Validations works good for Inconsistent specialization, 
       Ambiguous EL names, Unproxyable bean types, Decorator resolution
 *  3. Code completion works in beans.xml
 *  4. Classes in beans.xml are validated
 *  5. Complex test from Weld is working in JBDS and CDI functionality works without errors
 *  6. CDI @Named beans are renamed via refactoring and shows up correctly 
 *     when using Find References for EL Expressions
 *  8. Create new decorator from existing Web Bean
 *  9. EL refactoring for @Named beans works
 *  
 *  
 *  what tests have to be done(JBDS50_0015):
 *  1. OpenOn works for injected classes
 *  2. OpenOn works in Seam Config for given beans
 *  3. OpenOn works for Bean injected into java source files declard in seam-config.xml can be navigated
 *  4. Seam-beans.xml validation works
 *  5. Seam3 not-trivial example works with JBDS without errors and as expected
 *  6. Wel extension(beans_1_1.xsd) is now supported by beans.xml editor
 *  7. Non-serializable passivating-scoped beans are now validated correctly
 *  8. Code completion and validation works in seam config for annotated CDI beans
 *  9. Seam3 features is enabled automatically for CDI support enabled project containing corresponding Seam module
 *  10.CDI supports Seam3 annotations (@Veto,@Requires,@Exact,@MessageLogger,@MessageBundle 
 *     @DefaultBean,@Unwraps,@ServiceHandlerType,@FullyQualified,@Resource)
 *  11.CDI tools can work with generic beans and validation, code completion, hyperlinks, 
 *     refactoring is working as expected
