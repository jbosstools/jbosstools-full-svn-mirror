HOSTNAME_NOT_ANSWERING=We weren''t able to lookup your hostname ({0}) in a reasonable amount of time. This can happen periodically and will just take an extra minute or two to propagate depending on where you are in the world.\nOnce you are able to access your application in a browser, you can then clone your git repository.\nIf you can''t get your application running in the browser, you can also try destroying and recreating the application as well using this Wizard.\n\nIf this doesn''t work for you, let us know in the forums or in IRC and we''ll make sure to get you up and running.\n\nForums\: https\://www.redhat.com/openshift/forums/express\n\nIRC\: \#openshift (on Freenode)
