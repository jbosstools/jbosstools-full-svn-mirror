                      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Property Editor</emphasis> - BIRT View that displays properties for many report items. It has tabs and groupings that organize properties into categories.</para></listitem>
                      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Properties View</emphasis> - Standard Eclipse view that shows all properties for a report item as a simple list. This view is optional, and we will not use it in this tutorial.</para></listitem>
                      <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Library Explorer View</emphasis> - BIRT allows the reuse of report objects, such as tables, data sources and styles. Objects created for reuse are stored in a library file. The Library Explorer will display Libraries that exist in the resource folder. Developed libraries can be added to the resource folder by selecting Fileâ†’Publish Library to Resource Folder or by right clicking in Library Explorer and selecting add. The resource folder location can be configured. </para></listitem>

        <title>BIRT Report Designer Features</title>
        <para>Here are the main BIRT Report Designer features:</para>
        <itemizedlist><listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Palette</emphasis> - contains tables, labels, and charts. It is used in conjunction with the Layout View to design reports.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Data Explorer</emphasis> - Organizes your data sources (connections) and data sets (queries). The data set editor allows you to test your data set to ensure the report receives the correct data. Within this view multi dimensional cubes can be created using existing data sets. Cubes are currently used when building dynamic cross tables. This view also is used to design report parameters.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Resource Explorer</emphasis> - BIRT allows the reuse of report objects, such as tables, data sources and styles. Objects created for reuse are stored in a library file. To browse the contents of report libraries BIRT supplies a Resource Explorer view. This view list all libraries within the resource folder, in addition other shared content such as images and JavaScript files.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Property Editor</emphasis> - Presents the most commonly used properties in a convenient format that makes editing quick and easy.

            <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Script Editor</emphasis> - Scripting adds business logic to reports during data access, during report generation, or during viewing.

            <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Report Preview</emphasis> - You can test your report at any time with real data. The preview is a window directly within Eclipse.</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Expression Builder </emphasis> - BIRT expressions are really just simple scripts that return a value. Expressions are used for assigning data values to report elements, building image locations, hyperlinks, parameter default values and many other places. Expressions are constructed within BIRT using the Expression Builder.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Cheat Sheets</emphasis> - Learning a new tool is always a challenge, but Eclipse offers an innovative solution: cheat sheets. These are short bits of documentation that walk you through new tasks.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Outline</emphasis> - BIRT reports are organized as a tree structure with the overall report as the root, and separate categories for styles, report content, data sources, data sets, report parameters and more.
