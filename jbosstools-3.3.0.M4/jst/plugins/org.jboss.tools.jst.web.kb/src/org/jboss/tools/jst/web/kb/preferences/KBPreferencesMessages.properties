KB_DESCRIPTION=\
JBoss Tools Knowledge Base collects information from projects to provide info \n\
to features such as expression language, validation and content assist.\n\n\
It is recommended to enable this on projects and its dependent projects \n\
that use expression language features such as JSF, CDI and others.

KBValidationConfigurationBlock_common_description=\
Enabling Knowledge Base capabilities (nature and builder) on a project \n\
is required for correct work of other JBoss Tools capabilities. \n\
Since each Java archive is ready to provide JSF 2 resources, \n\
it is recommended to enable Knowledge Base capabilities on any \n\
Java project that is used as a module by another Web project.
