		This section lists all of the messages generated by the BPEL Validator. The SA (Static Analysis) column contains hyperlinks to the OASIS WS-BPEL 2.0 specification entry for each validation rule to which the message applies. It is possible that one message is applicable to more than one BPEL element or attribute, therefore all of the SA rules that are relevant are listed for each message.

		Refer to the OASIS documentation linked in the SA column for a detailed explanation of the BPEL requirement, and for possible resolutions for the error.
