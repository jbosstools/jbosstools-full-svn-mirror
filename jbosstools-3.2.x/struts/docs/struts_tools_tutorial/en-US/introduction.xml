  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>The following chapters describe how to deal with classic/old style of Struts development. We
    recommend users to use JBoss Seam to
    simplify development, but until then you can read about classical Struts usage here.</para>

  <para>We are going to show you how to create a simple <emphasis>
      <property>Struts application</property>
    </emphasis> using the JBoss Tools. The completed application will ask a user to enter
    a name and click a button. The resulting new page will display the familiar message,
    &quot;Hello &lt;name&gt;!&quot;</para>
  <para>This document will show you how to create such an application from the beginning, along the
    way demonstrating some of the powerful features of JBoss Tools. With the help of our tutorial you will design the
    application, generate stub code for the application, fill in the stub coding, compile the
    application, and finally run it all from inside the Eclipse.</para>
